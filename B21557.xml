            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Three things ought to be handled with great tenderness, an Exact Judgment, and an undaunted faithfulness, viz. <hi>The Eye, Reputation, and Religion.</hi> How far <hi>this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> hath acquitted himself, as to all, or either of these, by imposing upon his Readers <hi>visive faculty,</hi> and therein possibly his over-credulity, casting Dirt upon his <hi>Deceased Betters,</hi> either by traducing their Persons, with the Scandalous Name of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> or Wire-drawing their Notions to serve a private Interest, and rooting up thereby the <hi>very foundation</hi> of those truths, which he would seem to be a Mighty Defender of; Is that which is to be inquired into.</p>

            <head type="sub">To give Light into the true Nature and Tendency of this our <hi>Authors Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and the Manner of his Proceedings, in order to his Propagating, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing, and rendring of the same acceptable with his <hi>perhaps too unwary READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>AS to the matter of the same. That whatever of</hi> absoluteness <hi>he may seem to assign unto</hi> Election <hi>in the</hi> Father, <hi>whatsoever of</hi> compleatness <hi>or</hi> fulness <hi>in the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption <hi>wrought out by the</hi> Son, <hi>whatever of</hi> efficacy <hi>unto the</hi> Spirit <hi>in his work of</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; <hi>yet that the whole is no more, and for no other an end, than as subordinate unto a justification of our persons</hi> materially <hi>for a righteousness wrought</hi> within us. <hi>The result of which is (to speak the best of it) but a reintroducing of us into</hi> Adam's <hi>state be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, and that as to his Nature and Innocency therein, with this proviso, (which with him is the main, if not alone difference, between both Covenants.) That the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ, as to its meritorious attoning causes and effects, has made way for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maintaining of the same in us, answers for all its defects at present, and will present us, for the uses mentioned, as spotless and blameless hereafter with God in Glory. Therefore no wonder he insists so much on the Conditionality of the Covenant, when indeed, even the Conditions themselves, are the very matter of our justifying righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the manner of his proceedings therein. I shall give thee one instance of his Treacherous Dealing with the Word of God it self; by which thou maist discern into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, when he deals with this or the other Author, as either for or against him.—When</hi> Dr. Crisp <hi>speaks of the nature of the Sufferings of Christ, as an Expiatory Sacrifice, and that therein he underwent for the present the very</hi> idem <hi>for, and in the room of, the</hi> Elect, <hi>that they ought, as to their own real demerits, both personally and eternally to have undergone, viz.</hi> Poena damni &amp; poena sensus, <hi>i. e. The punishment of Separation as truly as that of wrath: He lops off the latter from the former part of one and the same Scripture, which the</hi> Dr. <hi>fully produces to prove his assertion by, and advises his Reader</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>well to construe those words of Christ,</hi> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</q>
               <hi>p. 294. comp. with our</hi> Author, <hi>p. 29 where he</hi> [our Author] <hi>sayes, that,</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>the whole notion is contrary to Scripture; for, under the greatest abatements of comfort, he owns God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence (and for the better deceiving of his Reader, leaves out,</hi> [Why hast thou forsaken me?] <hi>and relates only,</hi> My <hi>God, my God, Mat. 27. 46.</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>But for what follows, he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excludes it in his quotation, and hence immediately, from a partial account of this Text, he betakes himself, as for a blind, to Luk.</hi> 23. 46. Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit, <hi>&amp;c. As if there were no more in the sufferings of the Blessed Jesus for his Church, than what is incident unto nature upon its dissolution by death; save that thereby he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed pardon, and the communication of an inherent righteousness, as titular unto Glory, though all by his Merits; Not that he underwent in his glorious, gracious, condescending, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Mediatorial Person, as the publick and representative head of the Elect, and that as charged with their sin, the very utmost of wrath due unto the same, even when he</hi> alone <hi>for them</hi>

               <p>IT hath been my thoughts, that as no one thing will prove a more surprizing Cheat, than what is most like Truth, and yet, indeed, is not Truth; So, no Error is more likely to prove successfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive, than a refined one; yea, always the more <hi>refined,</hi> the more <hi>exitiall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the way and measure that some persons have revived in their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of late, for the carrying on of Reformation, hath been by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from (in part especially, as far as occasion, and a self-interesting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency might serve turn) what in its outward order, and discipline, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be most opposite unto, and destructive of the same, and therein to take up their rest; not duly regarding those <hi>fundamental</hi> (and as such more vitally essential) parts thereof, whereon the same must, if ever it infallibly, as to its Nature, and immutably as to its Duration, be built and established; or it will issue in the same ruinous overthrow, and disappointment with that House, whose superstructure, did not in the least, difference it from that which stood, but its Foundation: And this appears from that Sophistry, that runs, as in a continued and interlarding line, through some <hi>Polemically-Eirenick Treatises</hi> insensibly opening thereby a; Back-door unto <hi>Rome,</hi> to swallow up our Reformation, emptying <hi>Tyber</hi> into <hi>Thames,</hi> by leading poor silly wretches into the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> to seek after their Justification before God, and that both as to the Causes, Nature, Matter, Effects and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we shall in brief consider, the different Foundations, on which Persons, otherwise jointly bent against the General <hi>Apostacy</hi> in the Bulk, or open and more loose appearance thereof, did proceed in the work of Reformation; and wherein they were not a little, but some exceedingly divided amongst themselves, and that in no less an Article, than what is either in whole, or in part falsly so; or but pretendly, and falsely fundamental; amongst which there were such as thought it <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> necessary to Build the <hi>Reformation,</hi> upon that Solid, Square, Compleat and Rocky Principle, included in the whole of Christ's O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Hence it is, that Christ is said to be <hi>made under the Law,</hi> in an unlimitted sense, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. But for what? <hi>To redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> v. 5. But how? Was it only as to the Sanction-part thereof? which mainly respects an obnoxiousness to its Curse? No surely. This was not the design of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> for Purgatory was not then in fashion.

               <p>And let me add, that though no one can be saved by the <hi>Law,</hi> as it is a <hi>Covenant,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. Yet none shall enter into Life, as an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> but by the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of the same; and that either in the right of his own <hi>Personal Obedience,</hi> or that of another, <hi>Rom. 8. 4. chap. 10. 4. chap.</hi> 5. 19. This seems to me to be included in our Saviour's Answer unto the Lawyer, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 25. who would know of him, how he might obtain Eternal Life, and that as an Inheritance: The Answer, as becoming Divine Wisdom it self, is exceeding pertinent, vers. 26. <hi>What is written in the Law? How readest thou</hi> (which it is unto all the Elect) thou must lay thy <hi>claim</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and fix thy <hi>Title</hi> upon that <hi>Righteousness,</hi> which the Law includes in it, even the whole of it, and that either in thine own, or the Person of another. Hence it is, that Believers are said to be Heirs, <hi>and joynt-heirs with Christ,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. Of this sort of Reformers were <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. and several more Modern ones, whose Names will be had in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remembrance.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205130:4"/> matter of their Justification before God with in the compass of Christs passive obedience only, as some usually phrase it, or his sufferings unto death: These, though they were not as extensive, as could be wished, in their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maintaining the main and fundamental <hi>Article,</hi> whereon the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was built and carried on, yet they owned it in the reality of the same, as assiigning unto it it's main and more proper intendment and use (next to the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of an infinite offended <hi>Justice</hi>) that what he <hi>did</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> in his <hi>death,</hi> he did it not only as a distinct <hi>meditorial act,</hi> fitting him to become a <hi>Saviour,</hi> but in the room and stead of all the Elect, so that the same is imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, as if they themselves had done it: Of this number are <hi>Piscator,</hi> and several others in our dayes. The which <hi>Dr. Jacomb</hi> doth not a little bemoan. In his Preface to his Sermons on the 8th to the <hi>Romans,</hi> See <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. <q>So long as the strife lay between an <hi>Israelite</hi> and an <hi>Egyptian</hi> the matter was not very sad; but when the <hi>Israelites</hi> strove one against the other, then it was sad indeed: So here; so long as the contention was 'twixt <hi>Romanists</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> on one hand, and Protestants on the other, 'twas well enough; but when Protestants divide and differ amongst themselves, that's a matter of great sadness. In the body of this work I have had occasion only to contend with the former, and there I had nothing but Comfort; but in the end I was necessitated to take notice of and to interest my self in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the latter (concerning the imputation of Christ's Active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which some are for and some against,) and that afflicted me more than all that went before.</q> But.</p>

In a more general separation from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> at least as to it's exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal abominations, who yet did retain that which indeed is its main prop and support; without a thorow removal of which this <hi>Beast</hi> will stand in whatever societies this its root, footing and principle may be found: And the <hi>Abetters</hi> thereof, however they may escape him in his <hi>mark</hi> and <hi>name,</hi> yet sooner or later will be reckoned by the Spirit of the Lord amongst the <hi>number</hi> of the same. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 17. And such were those, who notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their owning of Christ his <hi>righteousness</hi> and <hi>merits,</hi> yet assigned unto him and them no other a room or place in the <hi>Justification</hi> of a sinner before God, than as the same made way for the presenting of such before him in an <hi>inherent righteousness</hi> as the <hi>matter</hi> thereof: Or, to be more express, That the <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>righteousness</hi> of Christ the <hi>Second Person</hi> in the Trinity, as to and for which he was and is <hi>Mediator,</hi> did procure such an act or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace from God the Father the <hi>first Person,</hi> that sinners should be Justified in by and materially for the righteousness of the <hi>third Person,</hi> which is no more, than the fruit of the Spirit in his work of <hi>Regeneration.</hi> There are too many books extant expressive of the truth of this <hi>Assertion:</hi> And that both of more ancient and modern Authors than can be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly denied.</p>

                  <hi>great Truth-stator and vindicator</hi> will be cast, the sequel of our present disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition (I hope) may in some measure inform us: And notwithstanding the Friendly <hi>colours</hi> he hangs out, yet I fear that upon a thorow grappling with him we shall find him not only a <hi>Pirate</hi> in Common, but a <hi>professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> in disguise and design, not far unlike the kindness the <hi>Dueller</hi> seemed to shew his <hi>Antagonist,</hi> bidding him beware of one behind him, who by his over-credulity turning to avoid a seeming danger, was run through by him.</p>
               <p>In order to our further procedure herein we shall consider what <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism</hi> indeed is, about which there are so many mere worldly discourses on foot this day. Therefore to omit it's literal signification, together with it's traditional acceptation, whereby it hath been managed rather to serve the interest of a party than really to inform the Judgment, we shall (God assisting) steer our course herein by the <hi>unerring Pole-star</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> by which alone it is that things as well as persons shall be finally determined. And herein I possitively assert, <hi>Antinomianism</hi> in the real root and sinfull nature thereof (I speak not of it's <hi>discovery</hi> in the fruits of the same) as it stands either <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly</hi> opposite unto the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and that either in doctrine or practice, is neither more nor less, than <hi>any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting or wresting of the Law of God either in whole or in part from it's proper use and designed end, for which it is fixed and placed in the hand of a Mediator, Gal.</hi> 3. 19. Hence it is that those with whom the Lord entred into covenant of old, he did it not only by sacrifice, <hi>Ps.</hi> 50. 5 but also by laying up the <hi>law</hi> not in part, but in both the <hi>Tables</hi> thereof, in the <hi>Ark, 1 Kings</hi> 8. 9. and herein lies the stated <hi>subjective fixedness and stability of the Covenant;</hi> though originated in the mutual compact betwixt the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> That what <hi>Adam</hi> and all his <hi>posterity</hi> in him had broken and rendred <hi>useless</hi> as to any <hi>benefit</hi> they were to expect from the same, becomes in and by the sole <hi>management</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> effectual unto life, peace and glory. <hi>Ps. 89. 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. 2 Sam. 23. 5.

               <p>The whole of these three Heads is summarily comprized in that one Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Nay that very Text which seems to be most Expressive of <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> in the common acceptation of the word, <hi>turning the Grace of God into Laciviousness,</hi> speaks indeed but of the Fruit, Consequences and Effects of the same, it being originated in a denial or rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ, as to the forementioned ends, <hi>Jude v. 4.

And it is also that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his said <hi>Office of writing the Law of God in the Heart,</hi> namely, <hi>by guiding into all Truth,</hi> and that as it is in <hi>Jesus,</hi> for he shall receive of his, and shew the same unto all his <hi>Disciples, Jo. 16. 13, 15. Eph.</hi> 4. 2. Thus <hi>Christ</hi> came to fulfil <hi>all Righteousness,</hi> and not to destroy any part of the Law, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 17.

Hence it is that from a consideration of the Promises being all in <hi>Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20. That the <hi>Apostle</hi> encourages the <hi>Corinthians to perfect holiness,</hi> c. 7. 1. But why, What are the Promises? Amongst the Divine unfathomable Ocean of them, this is one, and that no small one neither, <hi>Heb. 8. 10. I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.</hi> Of which Text <hi>our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> hath blest us with such an <hi>Antipodaean Explication,</hi> that for my share I should be apt to think, that if he walks, as he talks, it is with his heels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Therefore <hi>Eliphaz</hi> directed <hi>Job</hi> to the alone expedient for his Cure of that <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> which he and the rest of his friends falsly charged him with, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 22. q. d.

               <p>Now whoever they be that are found either in Doctrine or Practice to Parcel the Law out of the hands of <hi>Christ,</hi> by assigning what they think meet of the same unto his management for them, or diverting any branch thereof out of its proper place and order, not according with, or agreeing to the rule of his <hi>Engagements</hi> therein, and that for the <hi>Elect,</hi> or those that were given unto him, will certainly, more, or less, be found under the real charge of <hi>Antinomianism;</hi> whilst in the mean time their <hi>word Exclamations,</hi> (to say of them no more, but the best we can) may pass as lively evidences of their <hi>Empty Skulls.</hi>

It is true there is no <hi>elect</hi> vessel that can be capable of either discerning, receiving, improving or a truly prizing of this Undeserved distinguishing love, without a nature wrought in them by <hi>regeneration</hi>) suitable to, that from whence it springs, yet the love of God either in it's cause, reality or exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive nature is not more set towards or fixed upon their persons barely as such, than it was before. There is no increasing or diminishing of it, as it had it's rise from eternity in God from the <hi>purpose of his will,</hi> so will it's duration be unto Eternity with him, by vertue of the same <hi>unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purpose of his will</hi> towards them, though they discern it not. <hi>Jer. 31. 3.

               <p>From the whole of what hath been said, and a due Consideration of what our <hi>Author's</hi> treatise presents us withal, it will somewhat evidently and that shortly appear, That his sentiment and Judgment of <hi>Antinomianism</hi> in the root or originall cause, form and matter thereof, lyes in a gracious, real Commutation of sin and Righteousness betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Elect founded</hi> in a <hi>Judicially-compacted Covenant,</hi> not only in the meritorious causes and effects, but material substance of the same, and that as commutatively
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205130:6"/> transacted from each to other, not by infusion, but an <hi>infinitely solid, Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Compleat and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rreversible act of imputation.</hi> And truly where this is regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is morally impossible for any, that faithfully adhere to the same in the full Covenant-stated scope thereof to escape our most inspective Authors prodigious charge. The reason is plain, for how can I suppose the transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my sin in the act thereof unto or upon another, so as that by a correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive commutation the righteousness of <hi>his</hi> obedience in the very actual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof becomes mine, without an infusion of vitious habits, whilst I my self expect, unto whatever grace in the merits and causes thereof I may assign the same, to be materially Justifyed before God, from or for an <hi>inherent righteousness</hi> wrought within me; for that Soul that looks not after a righteousness in the matter thereof for his Justification unto life wholly from without himself, cannot possibly look upon sin in the act thereof as trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted upon Christ without entertaining the aforesaid blasphemous suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and that because the reason runs parallel on both hands; for as that righteousness for which we are reckoned Just, is not by <hi>infusion;</hi> so neither are those sins in their most vitious defilements, for which Christ is reckoned a sinner infused into him, but both by <hi>imputation:</hi> now to <hi>impute</hi> in the sense of these <hi>inherent Justiciaries</hi> is fully stated by <hi>Mr. Baxter;</hi> In these following words—<q>They talk much of <hi>Imputation,</hi> and neither know nor tell you what <hi>Imputation</hi> is; But take it mostly to be that which ever <hi>Dr. Crisp</hi> calleth a charging God with falshood; as if it were his <hi>reputing, reckoning, esteeming</hi> or <hi>supposing</hi> us to be what indeed we are not, or to have done or suffered what we did not, or to have what we have not; whereas <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth nothing (and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifieth nothing) but a true account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to be what we are, and to have done what we did, and to have what indeed we have; And to <hi>impute</hi> righteousness to us signifieth but truly to repute, account or Judge us righteous, <hi>Breviate of Justif. Proloug.</hi>
                  </q> And wherever this principle as such is rooted and fixed, such a persen (without grace prevent) is under invisible prejudices against this great fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental truth of Justification and also expos'd to betake himself to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prevarications, reproachful Calumnies, and false inconclusive suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and inferences in defence of the same, for it is impossible for such, if they will be true to their own principles in the Analogy of them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how sin should be transacted upon, or imputed indeed unto Christ in order to Justification, any otherwise than as they expect to receive a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness from him in order to the same, which is by infusion; Therefore the commutation spoken of must of consequence be unto them by Transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And alwayes observe it, that where the one is taken away, the other of course will fall to the ground: For why must a transferring of sin in the act unto Christ more necessarily infer a transfusion of inherent vitious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits into him, than a transferring of sin in the guilt and punishment of it only, must infer an habitual meritorious cause in him of sin in the said guilt and punishment thereof.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, why this Doctrine will not, in the whole of it, go down with

Of that which must necessarily presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the guilt: For, can any one legally be prosecuted against as guilty, who is in his own Person actually an offender, without a matter of fact be laid to his charge?

               <p>I. THE Method of his Proceedings against Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> as an <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> which is managed two ways, besides his general neglect of the whole scope of the Doctors Works. But before I proceed herein, let us see how <hi>Luther,</hi> our Generally-acknowledged first Reformer, especially in the Doctrine of Justification, draws by a Parallel-Line of Judment, in the same Yoke with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and that in his Treatise upon the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians, ch. 3. v. 13. fol.</hi> 135, 139 &amp;c. onely remember, that when <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> speaks of the whole World, or all Men, it's onely the <hi>Elect</hi> that we are to understand thereby. <q>Christ, <hi>sayes he,</hi> is innocent, as concerning his own Person, and therefore he ought not to have been hanged upon a Tree; but because, according to the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> every Thie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205130:8"/> to blaspheme the Name of the Lord, and briefly which hath and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all the sins of all Men in his Body: Not that he himself committed them, but that he received them being committed or done by us, and laid them upon his own Body, that he might make satisfaction for them with his own Blood. Therefore this general sentence of <hi>Moses</hi> comprehendeth him also, (albeit in his own <hi>Person</hi> he was <hi>innocent,</hi>) because it found him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst sinners and transgressors, <hi>Isa. 53. 5. Mat.</hi> 8. 17. like as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate taketh him for a Thief, and Punisheth him, whom he findeth among other Thieves and Transgressors, though he never committed any thing worthy of Death. Now Christ was not only found amongst sinners, but of his own accord, and by the will of his Father, he would also be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of sinners, taking upon him the flesh and blood of those which were sinners; Theives, and plunged in all kind of sin; when the Law therefore found him among Theives, it condemn'd him and killed him as a Thief▪ The Popish Sophisters do spoyl us of this knowledge of Christ, and most heavenly comfort, (namely that Christ was made a Curse, that he might deliver us from the Curse of the Law,) when they separate him from sin and sinners, and only set him out unto us as an example to be followed. By this means they make Christ not only unprofitable unto us, but also a <hi>Judge</hi> and a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> which is angry with our sins and condemneth sinners: But we must as well wrap Christ, and know him to be wrapr in <hi>our sins,</hi> in <hi>our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction,</hi> in <hi>our Death,</hi> and in <hi>all our Evils,</hi> as he is wrapped in our Flesh and in our blood. But some Men will say, it is very absurd and slanderous, to call the Son of God a cursed sinner; I answer, if thou wilt deny him to be a sinner, and to be accursed, deny also that he was Crucifyed and Dyed, for it is no less absurd to say, that the Son of God (as our Faith confesseth and believeth,) was Crucified and suffered the pains of sin and death, than to say that he is a Sinner and accursed; but if it be not absurd to confess and believe that Christ was Crucified between two Thieves, then it is not absurd to say also, that he was accursed, and of all <hi>Sinners</hi> the greatest. These words of <hi>Paul</hi> are not spoken in vain, and that, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. Jo.</hi> 1. 29. He verily is innocent, because he is the unspotted and undefiled Lamb of God; but because he beareth the sins of the World, his Innocence is burthened with the Sins and Guilt of the whole World, whatsoever I, Thou, and we all have done, or shall do hereafter, they are Christ's own Sins, are verily as if he himself, had done them. To be brief, our Sins must needs become Christ's own Sins, or else we shall perish for ever. This true knowledg of Christ, which <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> have most plainly delivered unto us, the wicked Sophysters have darkned and defaced. (Here is an <hi>Antinomian</hi> with a witness, for our <hi>Ambo-dexter Author</hi> to exercise his bifrontick skill, and Gigantick Manhood upon.) But further, <hi>saith he from</hi> Isa. 53. That <hi>God laid the Iniquity of us all upon him,</hi> we must not make these words less than they are, but leave them in their own proper significations, for God dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the words of the Prophets, but speaketh earnestly and of great Love, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Christ the Lamb of God,</hi> should bear the Sins of us all; but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:205130:8"/> what is it to bear? The Sophisters Answer to be Punished; very well; but wherefore is Christ Punished? Is it not because, he hath sin, and beareth sin? Now that Christ hath sin, the Holy Ghost witnesseth in <hi>Psal. 40. My sins have taken such hold on me, that I am not able to look up, yea they are more in number than the heirs of my head.</hi> In this Psalm and certain others, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> speaketh in the Person of Christ, and in plain words witnesseth that he had sins; for this Testimony is not the Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In pag. 2. He quotes <hi>the Doctor,</hi> pag. 363, 364. In reference to all Election, That <hi>if an Elect Person should happen to dye before he be called, yet that Election shall secure him,</hi> speaking of the certainty and <hi>Irreversibleness</hi> of that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>decree of God</hi> touching such an <hi>Elect</hi> Vessel: He does nor say he shall dye before he be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or regenerated, though this is that <hi>he</hi> would amuse his Reader with: The
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205130:9"/> expression is much like that of <hi>the Apostle Paul,</hi> Gal. 5. 4. <hi>Whosoever of you are justified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> Now we know that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Analogy of Faith,</hi> neither of these properly and nakedly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in themselves, as abstracted from the design of the Spirit of God in them, can be true. For can there be a Justification by the Law? Or a falling from Grace? Though <hi>our Author</hi> be for a falling away from Grace, as p. 162. Who can help him? For as he practifes, so he believes, and as he believes, so he practises: He can speak truth when it serves his turn, though with an Equivocation; he can boldly also maintain a Falshood, provided it be but neatly cover'd with a shew of truth: His words are, do not Divines generally conclude, that if <hi>David</hi> had not repented of his gross sins he fell into, he had Perished? For this let him repair to what <hi>David</hi> saith, when he comes as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an approaching Prospect of Eternity, whether it be his Repentance or <hi>God's Covenant</hi> barely as such, and not on the account of the former, that gives him cause to admire the goodness of God towards him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. Namely, God's having taken him into such a <hi>Covenant</hi> with himself, as was in all respects well ordered and sure. Compare with 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35. 22, 24. with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13.

                  </q> He further quotes the Dr. <hi>p.</hi> 375. and bids us see, and what we find there, no doubt but he thought it his safest course not to transcribe: As, <q>There is not a moment of time in which Iniquity is transacted back again from Christ, and remains upon a particular person—That this discharge of sin is the security of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from wrath.—That Sureties are the comfort of imprisoned and decayed Debtors, and so all along.</q> Also, <hi>p.</hi> 289. The Dr. holds forth the parallel betwixt the Scape-goat and Christ, in the Typical nature thereof; the Mystery whereof, whoever, as to its substance, discerneth it not, I dare warrantably say, he is no Believer. As for <hi>p.</hi> 28. we shall consider it anon; and therein, <hi>our Author's</hi> most notorious falshood: But all this is for no other end, as is manifest throughout the Chapter: and his whole Book indeed, but to introduce <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. not only as the very <hi>Conditions,</hi> for which we are pardoned, but the very matter, in which we must be justified, though he assign the cause of both, in the Merits of the same, unto the Death of Christ: This is directly <hi>the Council of Trent:</hi> Besides, the rank <hi>Socinianism</hi> that he belcheth out of his Blasphemous Gorge, in this very Chapter. <hi>Page</hi> 14. That things are so adjusted, that forgiving the Elect, should be an effect of Christ's <hi>Kingly Office,</hi> as well as his <hi>Priestly Office;</hi> for which he quotes, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. mark it well: He assigns as equal a cause unto Regeneration, which more particularly looks unto the <hi>Kingly Office</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> who, as a Prince, gives Repentance; as he does to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ, which more properly belongs to his <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> for the forgiveness and actual discharge of us from our sins. Thou wilt find, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Reader,</hi> That in the whole of his acknowledgments of Christ, as to his death and sufferings, That indeed he was no more than a Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sacrifice; which will further appear, <hi>ch. 6. p.</hi> 35.

On this foundation it is, that the Scripture fixeth our union barely and rootedly as such, in a passive sense, though thereupon it is by faith, that an actual, real, closing consent does issue, and communion from the same.

Again, our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 19. chargeth this as an Error upon the Doctor.—That the Elect, upon the death of Christ, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be sinners; and even since their sins are none of their sins, but they are the sins of Christ.—And for this he quotes the Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 8. <q>
                     <hi>Must not he be reckoned to be a sinner, while he doth sin?</hi> I Answer, No: though he doth sin, yet he is not to be reckoned a sinner; but his sins are reckoned to be taken away from him:</q> But leaves out what follows by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; <q>A Man borrows an Hundred pounds, some Man will say, <hi>Doth not he owe this hundred pounds, seeing he borrowed it?</hi> I say, No; in case ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath paid the Hundred pounds for him.</q>—Now either Christ hath fully satisfied Justice in his Death, for all the sins of the Elect, or he hath not; If he hath, the Dr. is right; If not, then Christ must be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Sacrifice, and died in vain. How much this savours of slighting the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> and reckoning it but a common thing; I think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>our Author</hi> to enquire into: further, he quotes the Dr. <hi>p.</hi> 270. to which I shall add, <hi>p.</hi> 271, 577, 578. wherein he clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. By a fraudulent and violent forcing (with a more than ordinary Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical boldness) of false conclusions upon what he cites of the Doctor's
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205130:11"/> and that either as his Judgment in the same, or as an unavoidably-genuine consequence of the same; Than which, I think, <hi>Hell</hi> it self, in the full compacted <hi>Caball</hi> of all its Inhabitants, cannot afford (as to the nature of it) a clearer instance of blindness, and yet malice, deceitfulness, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the complicated operations of the same. And this appears in that, when, and wherever the Dr. speaks of sin, as the transgression of the Law, to be laid upon Christ, which is fully explained, and all scurrilous and blasphemous consequences thereupon obviated by him, in that it is no otherwise but by a Commutative <hi>imputation of Christ's obedience</hi> unto us for <hi>Righteousness</hi> unto <hi>Justification,</hi> and our <hi>sin</hi> unto him as the <hi>Meritorious cause</hi> of <hi>his sufferings;</hi> He would presently perswade his Reader, by some <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical consequences</hi> (wherewith he seems to be as richly furnish'd as the <hi>Owles of Athens</hi>) that this cannot be without a Physical Transfusion of the defilement attending the transgression of the Precept, from one subject to another, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the Sinner unto Christ: A most blasphemous, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and groundless inference.—However, this he thought (as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ut suprà;</hi> or, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> say, <hi>Look in o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. In his second Chapter, he taxes the Doctor to hold, that God did not only impute the guilt, and lay the punishment of the sins of the <hi>Elect</hi> upon <hi>Christ,</hi> but he laid all the very sins of the Elect upon <hi>Christ,</hi> and that as to the real filthiness and loathsomness; yea, so that <hi>Christ</hi> was really the <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, Murderer</hi> and <hi>Sinner,</hi> and so accounted by the Father. Now, what countenance he hath received for this bold and wretched assertion, as to the ends for which he brings it, we must see into his Quotations of the Dr. together, how justly he hath dealt with him, As, <hi>p.</hi> 312. he tells us, <hi>That it is</hi> iniquity it self <hi>that</hi> the Lord <hi>laid upon Christ; not only our</hi> punishment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whether doth he say, that it was laid upon him, or infused into him? I confess, it is the former he says; and that in the very same Page, but that it was transacted to him. But, Doth he say, that it was transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into him? Not at all; but he says, It is not only iniquity, but iniquity <hi>it self,</hi> that the Lord hath laid upon Christ; and not onely so, but the <hi>fault</hi> of the transgression <hi>it self,</hi> and that with an, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I mostly fear: Nay, but he says more plainly, and names such sins, as that I dread, and am ashamed to mention them; How much more will not <hi>Christ</hi> stand aloof off from such things and persons guilty of them, as Idolatry, Blasphemy, Murder, Adultery, Theft, Lies, and Drunkenness; and that all these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came actually the Transgression of Christ, as those which have part in him, <hi>p</hi> 270. Now, if so, Christ must necessarily become unholy. And it is impossible that such an one should be a Saviour, nay, so much as a Prophet, who is thus made, to eat and to drink with, but also receive, and become a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:205130:11"/> friend of <hi>Publicans and Sinners,</hi> Luk. 5. 29, 30. ch. 15. 2. ch. 7. 34, 37, 39. Against such horrid black Doctrine, my heart doth rise even to a Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But, Doth he say, that though sin, in the fault or act of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, was so laid upon Christ, that he, in his own Person did either act, or commit it? No; that's not it; (<hi>though indeed it is it that he would amuse his Reader with;</hi>) but he says, That we are not compleatly sinful, but Christ being made sin, was as compleatly sinful as we, and (which plagues me more, there is another treacherous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that follows) that God himself did count him <hi>among the number of transgressors,</hi> p. 268. I pray, to avoid clamours and jealousies, let us hear the Doctor speaking for himself; As, <hi>p.</hi> 312. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>p. 265. That iniquity of Gods people is no otherwise disposed of, by way of Transaction from them, but only on the back of Christ;</hi> and not into him; none can bear or carry Iniquity from them, but he alone: <hi>p.</hi> 267. saith he, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, mistake me not, I say not, That ever Christ was, or that he ever could be the Actor or Committer of any Transgression; for he never committed any sin himself: p.</hi> 270, 268, 280. comp. <hi>p. 281, 272, 273, 283.

               <p>4. Of the <hi>Elect</hi> ceasing to be sinners, from the time their sins were laid on Christ, <hi>chap. 4. p</hi> 18. We have formerly heard the Snake in his hissings, but now we shall see him in his Bodily Appearance. His words are these, in reference to the whole of the Chapter; <q>Reader, I shall premise, 1 Men are sinners, or cease to be sinners, in several different respects, 1. As to the filth and obliquity of sin; with respect to this they are more or less sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: according to the degrees of their Innocence and Holiness. 2. With some▪ as to the guilt of sin, which refers to the Sanction of the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Offenders; with respect to this, the Offenders be more or less sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as they are forgiven, or not forgiven. 3. As to the charge of the fact, which was sinful; with respect to this, neither After sanctification, nor pardon, will deliver a Transgressor from having been a sinner; the fact was his. The first and last denominate one a sinner most properly. The second denominates a Man punishable, but not a sinner formally.</q>—Hence, Reader, observe, whence it is, That a sinner ceaseth, as an Elect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Vessel, to be reckoned of as such, in the account and estimation of God; and that thou wilt find, by his own Concessions here, as to the way of the removal of them, and that in the very guilt and charge of the same, <hi>viz.</hi> by forgiveness, and that as we are sanctified. As,</p>
               <p>With respect unto the Law▪ in its Sanction-part, which mainly looks upon sin in the guilt thereof; this <hi>our Author</hi> seems to acknowledge. But, How is this removed? meerly, 1. By forgiveness. And herein, if possible, he would, as he hath done amongst Men, breed a debate betwixt even the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God. Does Grace so pardon, as that Justice must not have a compleat Justification? And if ever it had it, When was it? For whom? And for what? Was it not when the Blessed Lamb of God, did by the one Sacrifice of himself, take away the sins of all the <hi>Elect?</hi> And if so, Can the <hi>Elect</hi> be charged with that, with which he was charged, and that upon their accounts? and for the removal of which, he laid down a full discharge in the shedding of his most precious blood? And was it ever known, that an Acquitment ought not to be as compleat as the Discharge? <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8. God himself cannot, but such as bear the Image of the Accuser of the Brethren (it seems) can. Let such an one have a care, least his own Sentiments devolve not as a Judgment upon his head. <hi>Ex ore tuo ferve nequam,</hi> &amp;c. For the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ himself, properly and barely as such, neither can, nor will save any that hath not a righteousness adequately corresponding with the <hi>righteousness of the Law,</hi> and that both in its Preceptive and Sanction▪ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17. compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4.

By <hi>Sanctification,</hi> i. e. when a person is made just and righteous, by an inherent qualification through Sanctification, then his sins are laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> he receives a pardon. This is the whole scope of this Chapter; And nothing in it does he assign unto Christ, but meerly what is barely meritorious; as he doe; in the whole of his Book. And I very much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:205130:14"/> question, whether so much would have been granted by him, but that he is equally afraid of Hell, together with the loss of his own inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; the interest of the later, it seems, the Merits of <hi>Christ</hi> shall subserve, because he hopes it will quit him from a share in the former. Though it is true, that a sence of Pardon, as arising in the seal of the Spirit, from, and to a work of real <hi>Sanctification,</hi> may be <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>evidences</hi> of the same; but it is in reference to a former <hi>acquitment from sin,</hi> as to its <hi>poenal and vindicative▪ charge.</hi> But, Whoever yet heard, that the truest mark, or sign, was, ever so proper to, and inseparable from that which it signifies, as to take place of that which is signified by it? Or must be so precedent unto it, either in order of time, or that of nature, that the shadow must give the substance a being? Was ever yet a Deed in Writing proved to be true, that was not so before? Do Evidences give beings to things? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they not so in the substance, title▪ and setled confirmation of them, before any such testimonies appear? His pitiful, undigested, yea blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously forced Consequences, in that part of this Chapter, which he calls, <hi>The Truth proved,</hi> or rather spit at and polluted from the vile ends, for which he produceth them, are not worth the noting: Only let me tell him this by the way, That he that Prays for the forgiveness of sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due regard unto that upon which the same is as well legally as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously founded (The main design of <hi>this Author,</hi> in the whole of <hi>this Treatise,</hi> being to overthrow the same,) will be so far from receiving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that his Prayers will be cast as filthy dung into his face, and himself continuing so, certainly spued out, as loathed by the Lord; though, for a while, he may swagger it out a little (like a drunken Beggar, who, till so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beriz'd fancies himself to be some body) in the rags of his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, let him▪ at his pleasure cast his <hi>Arminian</hi> eyes upon these Texts, and compare them together, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 7, 9. ch. 21. 1. ch. 3. 9.

I desire <hi>the Reader</hi> to take notice, if he have any regard to the welfare of his own soul, That when <hi>our Author</hi> speaks of the righteousness of Christ, especially as to the Imputation thereof, he either slily or ignorantly confines it unto that of his work as purely <hi>Mediatorial,</hi> (which mainly respects the qualisication of his person in the union of both natures, his essential and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent holiness, the edequate fitness of the offices assigned unto him for the carrying on of his Mediatory work, and that in the Application of the effects of the same unto his <hi>elect,</hi> through his intercession for them, when here on earth, and now in glory) But not a word of his rigteousness as a <hi>Publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> or <hi>Common head</hi> unto the <hi>Elect;</hi> that what they did, he considered under that capacity and in that relation unto them, was so truly <hi>imputed unto him,</hi> as that <hi>he was numbred amongst the transgressours,</hi> and <hi>made sin</hi> for their sakes, having <hi>their iniquityes so laid upon him,</hi> that they become in the Judgment of God the <hi>real meritorious cause</hi> of his sufferings.

               <p>For this purpose I will insert here a saying of, <hi>Pighius</hi> that I have read (though otherwise a <hi>Pontifican</hi> writer) which <hi>Soto</hi> answereth, and laboureth to clear from suspition of heresy, <hi>Pighius</hi> having considered sundry places of Scripture, as in the <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> &amp;c. that the Saints of God dare not bring their own inherent righteousness, to the strict tryal of Gods Judgment, <hi>Ex his confecit Pighius, &amp;c. (saith Soto) Pighius thence concludes, That our inherent righteousness, if it be strictly examined by the Divine rule, is not perfect, but we are Justified rather by that Righteousness of Christ imputed unto us, which he Exemplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that as</hi> Jacob <hi>hid under the habit of his elder brother, the true first-born, received his father's blessing; So we receive glory under another's person, to wit, Christ's.</hi> Now how doth Soto, with all his subtilty, acquit his <hi>Pighius</hi> from being an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in so saying <hi>Haec omnia, &amp;c.

Thus we see by what a pretty, neat distinction he would assoil his brother <hi>Pighius</hi> from being an heretick, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he speak the same thing with us: Only I pity <hi>Soto</hi> his sottishness, that while he would have <hi>Pighius</hi> to mean by our own righteousness, our natural righteousness, which may not abide Gods strict tryal; He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not upon what instances <hi>Pighius</hi> inferred this his true Catholick Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for his instances, by <hi>Soto</hi> his own allegation, were <hi>holy Job,</hi> and <hi>holy Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who disclaimed their own righteousness: But I hope <hi>Soto</hi> will not say, these were now na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And now being absolved or made righteous in a law sense, we have as much matter of glorifying in him, as absolved, acquitted sinners can have: We are Justifyed by his righteousness, that is, for that we are forgiven, and also entitled to life, which we had forefeited our selves, but we are not made inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, nor so esteemed; We are not accounted them who made the Attonement; We still take hold of, or acknoledge and approve, with reliance on it and submission to the terms of the Application of Christ's righteousness; That we by it may be forgiven, and this is our blessedness, Rom. 4. 7.

               <p>1. Single out the truly worthy, and more than ordinarily eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of our dear Lord Jesus, Doctor <hi>Owen;</hi> who, by the manner of our Author's citing him, is made but a meer Stalking-horse, that he might thereby the more covertly pursue his game. But before we proceed, by the way note this, as <hi>our Author's</hi> peculiar Checker-working-genius, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this his Treatise; That when he cites any truth, which is so really, in its own nature and proper place, out of any one Author; and thereby to represent a seeming Heterodoxy of what is more fundamentally Doctrinal in another; He makes indeed but an artificial engine of the same, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine that for which the former brings it in, and the latter as equally maintains; and thereby to introduce that, against which both of them mainly and jointly set themselves. Take an instance in general, and that both as to the persons and matter in hand before us—Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> asserts [as the main drift and scope of all his Writings (especially when he is upon this very Thesis) do manifest. That God hath nothing, and that he can find nothing to <hi>lay to the charge of his Elect,</hi> personally as such; no, not sin poenally as such, not but that the Dr. acknowledges them sinners in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, barely considered as such; but he speaks in reference to their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto Christ, as their representative Head, <hi>p.</hi> 270, 271. wherein, though he was and is Mediatour on their behalf, but not properly as Mediator is he a publick Person; for a Surety and Dayes-man are two distinct Offices, though both in Christ: And that sin was so transacted upon him, as that he was in a Juridical, or Law-sense, and that both by obligation from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Execution on the Cross, reckoned to be the Lamb of God, slain from the beginning of the World, both in the determination of God, and his own personal actual and untypical engagement for them in time; And that it is not when they believe, nor by, much less for believing, that God cannot charge an Elect Person with sin (as that it is not for, or because of calling, that Christ is the power and wisdom of God, but by being called we come to discern the same:) for this would either exclude a free Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and consequently an Immutability in him as also a sufficiency in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, or it must include, that God's charging, or not charging of a Person with sin, in a vindicative sense, depends really on Faith; for when an <hi>elect</hi> vessel is brought, through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205130:17"/> only in a meritorious, but material sense; that sin is either not charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, <hi>ut suprà,</hi> or that we are, or shall be justified before God; but that by believing, we come actually to apply unto our selves what was before both designed and done for us. This the <hi>Apostle</hi> is express in, Gal. 2. 10. <hi>I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9, 10. <hi>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the World began: But now is made manifest, by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to life, through the Gospel.</hi> And it is in defence of the very same truth, as to the sum and substance thereof, namely, the Doctrine of Justification (though, as to propriety of speech, they might differ in their Judgment) <hi>that Dr. Owen,</hi> as well as <hi>Dr. Crisp</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, (The latter <hi>our Author</hi> takes no notice of, as knowing it would spoil his design) being, in both of them, the same cautions, that in the Commutation of Persons, <hi>i e.</hi> Christ and Believers, by a transaction of sin and righteousness, it is not to be understood of infusion, but imputation: And yet this wretch, from a complication of craft, malice and impudence, would form a weapon out of those very Arguments, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> makes use of against the scurrilous charges of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> together with himself and others, to maim, undermine, and totally overthrow that very truth, (though it must needs be through the sides of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>) in the defence whereof they are both designed and urged. <hi>Treatise of Justif. p.</hi> 282, 283, 285. For he might as equally have curtail'd the obviating cautions of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> against Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> when he speaks particularly to the point in hand, as he hath done those of Dr. <hi>Owen's,</hi> in his charge against Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> when he is upon the same subject.

When we believe our Iniquities are laid on Christ, is one time; when God doth lay that iniquity that we in time do believe is laid, is another time. God, long before we believed, laid our iniquities upon Christ; and when we do Believe, the foundation of our believing is an ancient grant, that we find upon record, enacted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred long ago. Faith hath a word of truth, if it be truth whereupon it doth build. It looks not for present Revelations of things not extant before, but takes things as it finds them upon Record. When the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is first entred; nay, when the act was first made from whence the record was entred, then was the grant; then God did his part in <hi>laying of iniquity upon</hi> Christ: And we, in time, by the Grace of the Lord given to us do find out the ancient grant of his, which now, at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, becomes apparent, and so comes our Application.<note place="margin">Page 359.</note> Application is at present, or may be hereafter; but the <hi>laying of iniquity</hi> it self, is an act passed long before by God—Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laying of iniquity upon Christ, he doth not make a new act; all that he doth, is, by the publication and<note place="margin">Page 353.

And that, from eternity to eternity the Lord reckons all things as he had then and there set them down; we actually do commit sin to day, yesterday, and the sin of to morrow; they were all open and fair in the eyes of God, the Lord, from all eternity, looking upon these transactions, assented to this, that, that Christ, for whom he would prepare a Body, should, indeed, in time, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bear all these transgressions. But, in God's account, they must be reckoned, as born from all Eternity, by Christ, by way of <hi>Obligation.</hi>—Also, that <hi>the Lord did lay iniquity upon Christ,</hi> by way of execution: I mean thus, <hi>The Lord did lay iniquity upon Christ,</hi> as he did, in time, serve the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon Christ—<hi>Further,</hi> there is one thing more very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yet behind, that is, <hi>The Lord's laying iniquity upon Christ,</hi> by way of Application: I mean thus, when it is that the<note place="margin">Page 360.</note> Lord doth single out this and that, and the other person, that are now present; and doth take your very sins that you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and shall commit hereafter, When doth the Lord lay these very Iniquities upon Christ? Concerning the <hi>Elect</hi> in general, as they were in the eye of the Lord, before they had a real existence and being, so all their Iniquities were laid upon Christ from <hi>Eternity;</hi> But it must be granted, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, that the particular application of this Grace to Persons, that the Lord hath laid my Iniquities, and thy Iniquities upon Christ individually, must needs be in time. Before a Person is in being, there cannot be a Personal Application of the Grace of God unto that Person; God cannot
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205130:18"/> apply his Grace to nothing. Though, in his Eye, he may apprehend a Person, as being, though not actually being, and so reckon Christ as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, instead of that Person when he shall be; yet, to say, such a one by Name, this Person's Iniquities are laid upon Christ, and the Lord doth reckon thee in Person, as such a one, who hath not one Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he can charge upon thee, that is done in time. Now it will be<note place="margin">P. 361.</note> worth the while, to know when the Lord doth single out particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar several Persons, and when this Grace of laying this Persons Iniquities upon Christ, is appropriated by the Lord to this Person: For you must know, there is a two fold appropriation of God's Grace of laying Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon Christ. There is God's application, and Man's application; God's application is, when he himself doth say from Heaven, that he loves this very Person; and that the Iniquities of this very Person are carried away by Christ.

Yea, if Christ made any such satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us as is pretended, it is really ours, without any farther Imputation: For being performed for us and in our stead, it is the highest injustice not to have us accounted pardoned and acquitted, without any farther either Imputation on the part of God, or Faith on ours.</q> I suppose this may serve for a time as a delineatory breviate of <hi>our Authors</hi> critical reservations, till we hear whether <hi>Dr. Owen</hi> speaks more in his own, i. e. <hi>our Authors</hi> Dialect. or that of <hi>Dr. Crisp's</hi> which we shall find; Just preceding his quotation of him, in the same page; As follows, that <q>When the Lord Christ dyed for us, and offered himself as a Propitiatory sacrifice, <hi>God laid all our sins on him.

For what the <hi>Papists</hi> call <hi>Justitia Operum,</hi> the <hi>Righteousness of Works,</hi> they call a <hi>Personal inherent Evangelical Righteousness,</hi> whereof we have spoken before. And whereas the <hi>Papists</hi> say, That this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:205130:21"/> Righteousness of Works is not absolutely perfect, nor in it self able to justifie us in the sight of God, but owes all its worth and dignity for this purpose unto the Merit of Christ, they affirm that this <hi>Evangelical Righteousness</hi> is the condition whereon we enjoy the Benefits of the Righteousness of Christ, in the pardon of our sins, and the acceptance of our Persons before God. But as unto those who will acknowledge <hi>no other Righteousness</hi> wherewith we are justified before God, the meaning is the same, whether we say, that <hi>on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Righteousness,</hi> we are made partakers of the Benefits of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ; or that <hi>it is the Righteousness of Christ</hi> which makes this <hi>Righteousness</hi> of ours accepted with God.—This therefore, <hi>sayes the Doctor,</hi> is that which herein I affirm. <hi>The Righteousness of Christ</hi> (in his Obedience and suffering for us) <hi>imputed unto Believers, as they are united unto him by his Spirit, is that Righteousness whereon they are justified before God, on account whereof their sins are pardoned, and a Right is granted them unto the Heavenly Inheritance.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owens Treat.</hi> of <hi>Justif.</hi> p. 505, 506, 507.</note>
                     <hi>upon him,</hi> or causing them to meet on him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53 6. And this was by the Imputation of our sins unto him, as the Sins of the People were put <hi>on the Head of the Goat,</hi> that they should be no more theirs, but his, so as that he was to carry them away from them. Take Sin in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense before-mentioned, either of a Sacrifice for Sin, or a Sinner, and the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:205130:22"/> Imputation of the Guilt of Sin, antecedently unto the punishment of it, and in order thereunto, must be understood. For in every Sacrifice for Sin there was an <hi>Imposition of Sin</hi> on the Beast to be offered, antecedent unto the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of it, and therein its suffering by death. Therefore in every offering for sin, he that brought it, was to put his <hi>hand on the head of it,</hi> Lev. 1. 4. And that the transferring of the Guilt of Sin unto the Offering, was thereby sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, is expresly declared, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. Wherefore, if God made the Lord Christ <hi>a Sin-offering</hi> for us, it was by the Imputation of the <hi>Guilt of Sin</hi> unto him, antecedently unto his Suffering. Nor could any Offering be made for Sin, without a <hi>Typical translation</hi> of the Guilt of Sin unto it. And therefore, when an Offering was made for the Expiation of the <hi>Guilt of an uncertain Murder,</hi> those who were to make it, by the Law, namely, the Elders of the City that were next unto the place where the Man was slain, were not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Sacrifice, because there was none to <hi>confess Guilt over it,</hi> or to lay guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; But whereas the <hi>neck of an heifer</hi> was to be stricken off, to declare the punishment due unto Blood, they were to <hi>wash their hands</hi> over it, to testifie their own Innocency, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. But a Sacrifice for sin without the <hi>Imputation of Guilt</hi> there could not be. And if the word be taken in the <hi>second sense,</hi> namely, for a <hi>Sinner,</hi> that is, by Imputation, and in God's esteem, it must be by the Imputation of Guilt. For none can, in any sense, be <hi>denominated</hi> a Sinner from mere Suffering. None indeed do say, that <hi>Christ</hi> was made Sin, by the imputation of punishment unto him, which hath no proper sense; But they say, <hi>Sin was imputed unto him as unto Punishment,</hi> which is to say, that the <hi>Guilt of Sin</hi> was imputed unto him. For the Guilt of Sin is its respect unto Punishment, or the obligation unto Punishment which attends it. And that any one should be <hi>punished for Sin,</hi> without the <hi>Imputation of the Guilt of it</hi> unto him, is impossible; and were it possible, would be unjust. For it is not possible that any one should be punished for Sin properly, and yet that sin be none of his. And if it be not his by <hi>Inhaesion,</hi> it can be his no other way but by Imputation. One may suffer on the occasion of the Sin of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is no way made his, but he cannot be punished for it; for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the recompence of Sin on the account of its Guilt; And were it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Where is the Righteousness of Punishing any one for that which no way belongs unto him? Besides, Imputation of Sin, and Punishing, are distinct acts, the one preceding the other, and therefore the former is only of the <hi>Guilt of Sin;</hi> Wherefore the Lord Christ was made Sin for us, by the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Guilt of our sins unto him.</q>

               <p>Further,—<q>This was represented in all the Sacrifices of<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owens Treat.</hi> of <hi>Justif.</hi> p. 288.</note> old, especially the Great <hi>Anniversary,</hi> on the day of Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the Ordinance of the <hi>Scape-goat,</hi> as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So much for this Testimony; I see there is nothing like a cross-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Witnesses. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4. We shall examine a little of his Fourth Chapter, wherein he would charge Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> to maintain, That from the time the sins of the <hi>Elect</hi> were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:205130:23"/> laid upon Christ, they ceased to be sinners, and that in a formal sense; And ever since their sins are none of theirs, but they are the sins of Christ. In his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quotation he gives himself the lye, and that from what he cites out of <hi>the Dr.</hi> p. 8 And also add, pag. 9. Which hath been produced already in proof of the first general head. Now that <hi>the Dr.</hi> Means no more, than that such cease to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as respecting the <hi>paenal</hi> charge of sin, will appear from p. 289 290—<q>But what is <hi>this to the present purpose, if God did not really transact sin to Christ, nor never meant to do it? For if he hath not done it already, he never will do it; I say if he</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. Crisp's works. p. 289. 290.</note>
                     <hi>neither hath nor will, how doth this place prove that he calls things that are not, as though they were? This is certain, Beloved, although all things that ever shall be in the World, are most present to the Lord at one instant: For so they may be said to be in respect of Him, though in respect of the things themselves they yet are not: Yet in all the Scripture you shall never find the Lord expressing himself so, he never calls things thus and thus, when they never are nor never shall be. If Christ have not already born the sins of Men himself, then certainly never shall he bear their sins: For he is not now to do any more, to compass any thing not compassed; And if neither here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore sin hath been, nor hereafter shall be laid upon him, how can God call that which was not, nor never shall be, as if it were.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>There is therefore, beloved, a certain transacting of sin upon Christ, so really, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Believer though an actor of Transgression, is as absolutely and truly discharged of his sins as if he himself had not commited them. As a Debtor, when a Surety hath taken the Debt on him, and the Debtor receives an acquittance and discharge, he is as free of the debt now as if he had never run into that debt, so I say is it with a Believer Christ being made a Surety of a better Testament: And thereby becoming really and truly the Debtor instead of Believers, he so bears all the Debt himself, that they are altogether released, and discharged, and freed, as if they never had been in debt. Still I say, this hinders not, but that there is an acting of sin, and commiting of sin every day by the Believer, but still, the vertue of Christ's Suretiship takes off the sin, as soon as ever it is committed, nay, he hath a Proviso a Stock in hanck to satisfy for it before the Commission of it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And let me add, what the Apostle says, <hi>Rom. 5. 20, 21. Moreover the Law entred, that the offence might abound: But where sin abounded, grace did much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto Eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further <hi>the Dr.</hi> proves excellently well the interest an <hi>elect</hi> vessel hath in Christ, from faiths being the fruit of union.—<q>Let us suppose, that coming in this place is spoken of believing: <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life;</hi> It cannot follow, that although there be no life till believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Dr. Crisp's works. p. 614. 615.</note> therefore there can be no union till believing: I say, if it possibly might be imagined, that there may not be life from Christ, till believing, yet it follows not that there must be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before there is union. Nay beloved, there is nothing clearer in all the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d than this principle; Namely, suppose there cannot be life before there be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lieving, yet there must be union before there can be life fetched from Christ; I say, there must be union before believing can fet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h life from Christ. For, suppose that the fruit upon a branch should have such a faculty to draw
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:205130:23"/> life into the branch from the root; Though this would be a strange conceit, that the fruir growing upon a tree, should have a faculty to draw life from, the root to the branch, whereas the root communicates life to the branch, and the branch, by vertue of that life communicated, brings forth fruit. But yet, suppose the fruit should draw life into the branch, from the root, that is, suppose that faith which is a fruit, growing upon a member of Christ, that is a believer, and a branch, of that body; Suppose that faith this fruit should have such a faculty to draw life from Christ the root into the branch, yet it is impossible that faith should draw life into the branch, till the branch be unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the stock: For, beloved, that is Christ's comparison: <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches;</hi> Now, take this comparison; Suppose a branch growing upon a wild Olive, it is cut off from the wild Olive, and for the present it is not united to the good Olive tree; Now can a wild Olive, or suppose it to be a good Olive upon this branch of the wild tree, can this fruit upon the branch draw life from the root of the good Olive-tree, while it is separated and laid aside, and is not united to the good Olive, from which root it must draw life? It is Known to all men, that communion is the fruit of union; There is no participation nor communion of any thing that is Christ's, but as it doth flow from union with Christ; So that either you must say, that faith which you speak of, is not of Christ the root, but hath some other root and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence it hath it's being and essence; Or else you must confess, if Christ be the root, then it must come from Christ by vertue of union of a Believer to Christ first.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finally, suppose it should be, that coming is believing; Suppose that this life spoken of here, is not in persons till they do believe: What is meant by life here? Beloved, I beseech you consider, the Apostle tells us, <hi>our life is hid with Christ in God; And Christ is the life of the world,</hi> that is of the elect. It seems then that the life of every elect person hath a being in Christ, before he doth believe; Believing therefore doth not produce a new life that was not before; only it manifests that life which was before, and makes that life an active life; Or is an instrument by which that life that is hid in Christ, doth now after believing, become an active and appearing life in this person; So that all that can be made of this, is but this; Till believing, there is no activeness of the life of Christ in the person that is elected, his life is in Christ, and was in Christ, and reserved in Christ, till the time of believing, for him; And then doth he the Elect person, become active in life, when Christ doth give him to believe actually.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But to say that this believing should give the first being of that life that should be in persons, is to say, there is not that life of the elect persons in Christ before they do belive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If there must be our Act of believing, before there be participating<note place="margin">p. 616.</note> in Christ, then mark what will follow those fins which were once laid upon Christ, and taken away from the elect; (For they could not be laid upon him unless they were taken from them) th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:205130:24"/> acknowledged full satisfaction, so that those sins were once blotted out; I say if there must be believing before there be union with, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est<note place="margin">Dr. Crisp's works. 616. 617. 618.</note> in Christ, it must necessarily follow, that till such believing, the person of that elect, doth bear his own transgression, and is chargeable for his own transgressions, and his transgressions are imputed unto him. But how can it stand with the glory of the Redemption of Christ, that Christ should have all Iniquity laid upon himself, carrying all Iniquity like the scape-goat into the Land of forgetfulness, and yet till the time of that elect persons believing, these sins are returned from the Land of forgetfulness whither they were once carryed, and are a-fresh charged upon this person again. Did Christ bear them away? And did Christ return them back again? Where did you ever find, that sin once taken away, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed a way by Christ from the person offending, did return back again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the person from whom Christ took it away? Suppose this, that men have no interest in Christ, till actually they do believe in him, then it must follow, that these persons, till they are actually believers, are under the hatred of God; For, if they bear their own transgressions themselves, then God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Jealous God, his holy and pure nature everlastingly hating iniquity, and also the person upon who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </q> This is also further included in his stating the ground of the <hi>Drs</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,—<q>That because the hidings of God's Face, and especially the dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ (who, it seems, was as truely a Sacrifice, and an Expiation for sin in his life, differing only in degree, as in his death) did so compleat and finish the Work of Satisfaction, as the <hi>principal parts thereof,</hi> &amp;c.</q> If this be not <hi>Socinianism,</hi> next to a denial of the Divine Nature of Christ, in the rankest degree thereof, I know not what is: Now, as to what the <hi>Dr.</hi> says, is, in reference to an Expiatory Sacrifice for sin; and this peculiarly relates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ's <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> not but that he stood under a Juridical charge of sin all his life long, and Immetaphorically underwent the bitter effects of the same, even from his Birth to the Sentence pass'd upon him by <hi>Pilate.</hi> But none of this was a shedding of blood (though he did Sweat Clots of Blood before) in which the very Essence of a Sacrifice lies, and without which there is no remission, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 22. And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood; and <hi>without shedding of blood there is no remission.</hi> It was then, and then only he actually redeemed by laying down a Price: It was then, and then only he actually <hi>reconciled by the Sacrifice of himself:</hi> It was then, and then only, he actually satisfied for all the <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Proceed we in the next place to his 6th chapter.</p>
               <p>6. This chapter tells us of a notable discovery <hi>our Author</hi> has made, That <hi>Dr Crisp</hi> it seems did not only say that sin was transacted and laid on Christ, which we have heard how and what he meant thereby, but that he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and loathed even in his person of God; And quotes him, p. 294. 295, 408. To which I shall with <hi>our Author's</hi> undisturbed leave call in afterwards p. 409. He adds also p. 279 380, 180. But before we fall into a strict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the point, consider, That God manifests his indignation, abhorrency and wrath against none of his creatures either Angelical or humane barely as such, much less against him who was not onely immaculate and undefiled, but also essentially one and of the same divine nature with himself, but that on whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever sin is charged, either really or by way of impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This we shall find very clear in what <hi>our Author</hi> is pleased to cite of <hi>the Dr's—</hi>

                     <hi>Nay, from this I affirm, as Christ did bear our Iniquity, so Christ for that Iniquity was separated. Dr Crisp's works p. 294. From God; (Now how was it that Christ did bear our</hi> Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? Sure so as to be charged with the full demerits of them: What were the demerits of them? Mainly a separation betwixt God and the sinner, and therefore said <hi>by his blood to bring nigh them who were sometimes afar off. Eph</hi> 2. 13.)</q> For which the <hi>Dr.</hi> Brings a proof, though <hi>our Author</hi> thought meet to omit it, <hi>viz.

                  <q>This now must needs commend the love of God to Men, that while Men▪ who had deserved Wrath, are in rest and peace,<note place="margin">Dr. Crisp's works. p. 409.</note> Christ should not only bear the afflictions of men but the very sins of men too; That God should not only expose his Son to the rod, but to put him into a <hi>posture of wrath;</hi> For putting him
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:205130:26"/> into <hi>a posture of bearing sin, he must needs put him into a posture of bearing Wrath;</hi> this heightens the Love. It is a great and high expression of Love to adopt a stranger, and make him coheir with his only son. If one that hath but one Son, and that a beloved son, do this, he shall be a Mirrour to the World; If he take in a Stranger, a Theif and Murderer, to divide the inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Son and him. But beloved, for God not only to take in the Sons of Men Traytors and Thieves, to be <hi>Coheirs</hi> with his own Son; But also that the Lord should lay the Felony of such Thieves, and the murder of such mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and the treasons of such Traitors as we are, upon this Heir the son of glory; To lay this upon him, and to execute him for this our Felony and Treason, that we who are Thieves may be the Sons of God; This I say is the astonishing love of God, whereunto there is never a parallel in all the World.

Which makes me not a little wonder at his impudence herein, especially in the manner of his charge; and though he acknowledgeth that the soul of Christ endured the effects of God's wrath against sin, which would look pretty fair from a well meaning man; But that this was no more than that he was amazed chereat as at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the work, &amp;c. And that God testifyed his threatned indignation against sin (but that this came not in the Execution thereof upon Christ, as charged with the full demerits of the same) in that his soul and body was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonized in some sort by awfull sufferings, &amp;c. Which is but to make a meer stage-play of the passion of Christ. For this he quotes <hi>Dr. Owen.</hi>—<q>There was no reason why God should <hi>hate Christ</hi> for his taking on him out Debt and the payment of it (and omits what follows) in an act of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Obedience unto his will.

               <p>7. The Seventh and last thing which I shall note, with respect unto his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar way, in Ticketting of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> as Witness, and that as we have heard, meerly to subvert the great Doctrine of <hi>Justification,</hi> by a mis-representation of those very notions and things, that he introduces for the maintaining and fortifying of the same.</p>
               <p>The Title of this <hi>our Author's</hi> Chapter, being a change of Person between Christ and the Elect, and their being as righteous as he.</p>
               <p>Now to wave a just Discussion of this head, he slides off, very subtilly, to a change of Natures, <hi>i. e.</hi> from a Moral, to a Physical change. We have had enough of this before, in both the <hi>Drs</hi> clearing themselves in this Point. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I shall take notice of what more peculiarly belongs unto Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> as his Testimony in this case, and therein let the <hi>Reader</hi> guess, how far it makes for or against Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> or <hi>our Author:</hi> though I would desire the <hi>Reader</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind, <hi>ut prius,</hi> that he never considers Christ as a Publick Person, but barely as Mediator; and though the former be included in the latter, yet they are both exceedingly distinct, though both entirely in him.</p>
               <p>The Truth (as he calls it) by him stated thus, which I shall faithfully transcribe, only desire the <hi>Reader</hi> would as equally pass by the intrusion of a Parenthesis here and there that may occasionally drop, as I would free him from a charge of presumption, though he fired his Pipe at the same Light with my self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  <q>The Mediatorial Righteousness of <hi>Christ</hi> is so imputed to Believers,</q> (his Righteousness properly, as Mediatorial, is not at all imputed unto him; though the Righteousness of him, who is Mediator, as their <hi>Representative Head</hi> is; for, if so, they would be their own Intercessors) <q>as that for the sake thereof they are pardoned and accepted unto life eternal, it being reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and pleadable by them for these uses, as if they had personally done and suffered what <hi>Christ</hi> did as Mediator for them, whereby they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Curse, and no other attonement or meriting price of saving benefits can be demanded from them,</q> (Their pardon is no more than an acquitment, and that from an obnoxiousness to what is evil; it does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly give a Title unto any thing above what is meer releasement, much less unto life eternal.) <q>Neverthess, this Mediatorial Righteousness is not subjectively in them; nor is there a change of persons between them and Christ; nor are they as righteous as he.</q> (Who ever said so? or, at leastwise, Who ever dreamt that a change of Persons must necessarily infer a transfusion of qualities?) <q>But there remain spots and blemishes in them.</q> (<hi>But.</hi> But what is this <hi>But?</hi> there is no spot in the Righteousness that Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies brought against him do plead for; for as it never wanted perfection in its kind, so neither was it designed to be, or shall ever be actually imputed unto <hi>Elect</hi> believers, by parts or degrees) <q>until <hi>Christ,</hi> by his Spirit, perfect the holiness begun in all true believers; which he will effect, before he bring them to Heaven.</q> (It is thought, that Heaven alone is the state of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that there is no <hi>medium</hi> from a state of Mortality unto that of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holiness, unless we call at Purgatory by the way.) Now let us sum up
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:205130:28"/> the Evidence of this Truth, that when <hi>Christ,</hi> by vertue, or through the Merits of his Mediatorial Righteousness (provided it be not subjectively in us) hath so procured the Spirit, as to perfect that holiness, which he hath begun in all true believers; why then they may stand justified before God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus our Mountain hath brought forth a Mouse.</p>
               <p>Now let us see what Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> says unto this Charge against Dr. <hi>Crisp.</hi>—<q>But yet some will not distinguish between the Covenant of the Mediator, and the Covenant of Grace, because the Promises<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owens Treat.</hi> of <hi>Justif.</hi> p. 268, 269.</note> of the Covenant absolutely are said to be made to <hi>Christ,</hi> Gal. 3. 16. and he is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or first subject of all the grace of it: But in the Covenant of the Mediator, <hi>Christ</hi> stands alone for himself, and undertakes for himself alone, and not as the Representative of the Church. But this he is in the covenant of Grace. But this is that wherein it had its designed establishment, as unto all the ways, means, and ends of its accomplishment; and all things so disposed, as that it might be effectual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eternal Glory of the Wisdom, Grace, Righteousness and Power of God. Wherefore the covenant of Grace could not be <hi>procured</hi> by any means or cause, but that which was the <hi>cause</hi> of this Covenant of the Mediator, or of God the Father with the Son, as undertaking the work of the Mediation. And this is no where ascribed unto the <hi>Death of Christ</hi> in the Scripture; So to assert it, is contrary to all Spiritual Reason and Understanding. Who can conceive, that <hi>Christ</hi> by his Death, should procure the <hi>Agreement</hi> between God and him, that he should die.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further,</hi>
                  <q>But some have other notions of these things,</q> For they say, that <hi>Christ by his Death, and his obedience therein, whereby he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Sacrifice of sweet smelling savour unto God, procured for us the</hi>

                  <hi>New Covenant;</hi> or, as one speaks, <hi>All that we have by the Death of Christ, is, that thereunto we owe the Covenant of Grace. For herein he did and suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>red what God required, and freely appointed him to do and suffer. Not that the Justice of God required any such thing with respect unto their sins, for whom he dyed, and in whose stead, or to bestead whom, he suffered; but what by a free Constitution of Divine Wisdom and Soveraignty was appointed him. Hereon, God was pleased to remit the terms of the old Covenant, and to enter into a new Covenant with Mankind upon terms suited unto our Reason, possible unto our abilities, and every way advantageous unto us. For these Terms are Faith and Sincere Obedience, or such an assent unto the Truth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations, as is effectual in Obedience unto the will of God contained in them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the encouragement given thereunto in the Promises of Eternal Life, or a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made therein. On the performance of these conditions, our Justification, Adoption, and future Glory do depend; For they are that Righteousness before God, whereon he pardons our sins, and accepts our persons, as if we were perfectly righteous.</hi>
                  <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this procuring the New covenant for us, which they ascribe unto the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> they intend the <hi>Abrogation</hi> of the Old covenant, or of the Law, or at least such a <hi>Derogation</hi> from it, that it shall no more oblige us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto sinless Obedience, or Punishment, nor require a perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto our Justification before God; and the constitution of a new <hi>Law of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:205130:28"/> Obedience,</hi> accommodated unto our state and condition, on whose observance all the Promises of the Gospel do depend.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Others say, That in the death of <hi>Christ</hi> there was real satisfaction made unto God; not to the Law, or unto God according to what the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but unto God absolutely. That is, he did what God was well pleased and <hi>satisfied</hi> withal, without any respect unto his Justice, or the curse of the Law. And they add, That hereon the <hi>whole Righteousness</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is imputed unto us, so far, as that we are made partakers of the Benefits thereof. And moreover, that the way of the communication of them unto us, is by the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which by his <hi>Death the Lord Christ procured.</hi> For the <hi>conditions</hi> of this covenant are established in the covenant it self, whereon God will bestow all the Benefits and Effects of it upon us, which are Faith and Obedience. Wherefore what the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for us, is thus far accepted, as our <hi>Legal Righteousness,</hi> as that God, upon our Faith and Obedience, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect thereunto, doth release and pardon all <hi>our sins of omission</hi> and <hi>commission.</hi> Upon this Pardon there is no need of any positive perfect Righteousness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Justification or Salvation, but our own <hi>Personal Righteousness</hi> is accepted with God in the room of it, by vertue of the New covenant which Christ hath procured. So is the Doctrine hereof stated by <hi>Cursellaeus,</hi> and those that join with him, or follow him.</q>

And so is it on the other side. And as we are made Guilty by <hi>Adam's</hi> actual sin, which is not inherent in us but only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us; So are we made righteous by the Righteousness of Christ which is not inherent in us, but only imputed unto us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi>—<q>In this Imputation, the <hi>thing it self</hi> is first imputed unto us, and not any of the <hi>effects</hi> of it, but they are made ours by vertue of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. To say that the Righteousness of Christ, that is, his Obedience and sufferings are imputed unto us only as their effects, is to say that we have the <hi>benefit</hi> of them, and no more; But imputation it self is denyed.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the <hi>Righteousness of Christ is imputed unto us, as unto its effects,</hi> hath this sound sense in it; Namely, that the effects of it are made ours, by reason of that imputation. It is so imputed, so reckoned unto us of God, as that he really communicates all the effects of it unto us. But to say the Righteousness of Christ is <hi>not imputed</hi> unto us, only its effects are so, is really to overthrow all Imputation For (as we shall see) the effects of the Righteousness of Christ cannot be said <hi>properly</hi> to be imputed unto us; And if his Righteousness it self be not so, Imputation hath no place herein, nor can it be understood why the Apostle should so frequently assert it as he doth, <hi>Rom</hi> 4. And therefore the <hi>Socinians</hi> who expresly oppose the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, and plead for a participation of it's effects or benefits only, do wisely
<pb facs="tcp:205130:30"/> deny any such kind of Righteousness of Christ, namely, of <hi>satisfaction and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> (or that the Righteousness of Christ as wrought by him, was either satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory or meritorious) as alone may be imputed unto us. For it will readily be granted, that what alone they allow the Righteousness of Christ to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in, cannot be imputed unto us, whatever benefit we may have by it. But I do not understand how those who grant the <hi>Righteousness of Christ</hi> to consist prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in his satisfaction for us, or in our stead, can conceive of an <hi>Imputation of the effects</hi> thereof unto us, without an imputation of the thing it self. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is for that as made ours, that we partake of the benefits of it. But from the Description of Imputation and the Instances of it, it appeareth that there can be no Imputation of any thing, unless the <hi>thing it self</hi> be imputed, nor any participation of the Effects of any thing, but what is grounded on the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the thing it self. Wherefore in our particular case, no Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ is allowed, unless we grant it self to be imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Nor can we have any Partitipation of the effects of it, but on the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and foundation of that Imputation. The impertinent Cavils that some of late have collected from the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> that if it be so, then are we as <hi>Righteous as Christ himself</hi> that we <hi>have redeemed the World,</hi> and <hi>satisfyed for the sins of others,</hi> that the <hi>pardon of sin is impossible,</hi> and <hi>Personal Righteousness need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> shall afterwards be spoken to, so far as they deserve.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>All that we now aim to demonstrate, is only, that either the <hi>Righteousness of Christ it self</hi> is imputed unto us, or there is no Imputation in the matter of our Justification, which whether there be or no, is another Question after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be spoken unto. For as was said, the effects of the Righteousness of Christ, cannot be said properly to be imputed unto us. For Instance, Pardon of sin is a great effect of the Righteousness of Christ. Our sins are pardoned on the account thereof God for Christ's sake forgiveth us all our sins. But the <hi>pardon of sin</hi> cannot be said to be imputed unto us, nor is so. Adoption, Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Peace with God, all grace and Glory, are effects of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ. But that these things are not imputed unto us, nor can be so, is evident from their Nature. But we are made partakers of them all upon the account of the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ unto us, and no otherwise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Further <hi>our Author</hi> tells us in this chapter,—<q>That this change of persons,</q> (which indeed as we have heard is no more than a relative change, though he divert it from that to an inward physical one, meerly to turn aside sinners from expecting a Righteousness that way, that it) <q>is impossible, ungrounded and absurd. p. 38. 39.</q> We will see what <hi>Dr. O.</hi> Sayes to this. p. 363. 364, 365. &amp;c.—<q>The things that are usually objected and vehemently urged against the Imputation of the Obedience of Christ unto our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, may be reduced unto three heads. 1. It is pleaded <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. Owen's Treat. of Justif. p. 363. 364.</note> on this single ground;</q> Namely, That the <hi>obedience of Christ unto the Law was due from him on his own account, and performed by him for himself, as a man made under the Law.</hi>
                  <q>Now what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto <hi>himself,</hi> and done for <hi>himself,</hi> cannot be said to be done for us, so as to be imputed unto us.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:205130:31"/>
               <p>
                  <q>2. It is pretended to be <hi>useless</hi> from hence, because all our <hi>sins of omission and commission being pardoned in our Justification, on the account of the death and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, we are thereby made compleatly righteous; so as that there is not the least necessity for, or use of the Imputation of the Obedience of Christ unto us.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. <hi>Pernitious</hi> also they say it is, as that which takes away the <hi>necessity of our own personal obedience, introducing Antinomianism, Libertinism, and all manner of evils.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For this last part of the charge, I refer it unto its proper place: For altho' it be urged by some against this part of the Doctrine of Justification in a peculiar manner, yet is it managed by others, against the whole of it. And although we should grant, that the <hi>Obedience of Christ unto the Law,</hi> is not imputed unto us unto our Justification, yet shall we not be freed from distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance by this false accusation; unless we will renounce the whole of the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and merit of Christ also:</hi> And we intend not to purchase our peace with the whole World at so dear a rate. Wherefore I shall, in its proper place, give this part of the Charge its due consideration, as it reflects on the whole Doctrine of Justification, and all the causes thereof, which we believe and profess. As for the clearing of these three Heads, I shall refer the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to the place it self.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus stated the <hi>Dr's</hi> Judgment in this Fundamental <hi>Article</hi> of our Faith; we may the more clearly see into the impudent Treachery of our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> in what he quotes of him: And, herein, I positively, though I hope in a Christian way, give him the Challenge, together with the <hi>Assistances</hi> of all his present, as well as future <hi>Subscribers;</hi> to shew me, that there is the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as to matter and substance (whatever difference, as to manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be) betwixt Dr. <hi>O. Elders of the Savoy, Assemhlies,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> as to the Doctrine of Justification; nay, that they do, not all of them, conjoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Argue and Attest for that very same fundamental truth, for the everting and undermining of which it is, that our <hi>Author</hi> cites them one against the other.

               <p>Now, that it is not a bare or forced charge against our <hi>Author (viz.</hi> that he is guilty herein of an impudent Treachery in his Quotation of the <hi>Dr,</hi> in this, as well as others of his Chapters.) See him, <hi>p</hi> 42, 43 where you will find him, either distending a Sentence beyond its proper and circumscribed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; or distorting it from its peculiar and relative dependance upon what either precedes or follows, and thereby wholly unbowelling the same, of that genuine matter, form and energy for which it is designed by its Author. As in reference to the Chapter in hand, and therein a change of persons, as you heard of before; He quotes the <hi>Dr.</hi>—To say, <hi>That we are as righteous as Christ,</hi>
                  <q>is to make a comparison between the Personal Righteousness of Christ, and our Personal Righteousness, if the comparison<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen's Treat.</hi> of <hi>Justif.</hi> p. 509, 510.</note> be of things of the same kind.</q> (Mark this Reader) <q>But this is foolish and impious.

(But, Wherefore is this spoken, and to whom? See what lineally follows, and that in one breath) and are made partakers of it. There is therefore no ground for any such compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</q>—As unto what is added by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (whom our <hi>Author</hi> can quietly let pass and undisturbed, as knowing whose Livery he wears, and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Communication the Man is of, so he can but sufficiently Avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on <hi>Dr. Crisp,</hi> I mean his Doctrine) <q>that we may hereon be said to <hi>be Redeemers and Saviours</hi> of the World, the absurdity of the assertion falls upon himself (just as it does upon our <hi>Author</hi>) we are not concerned in it. For he affirms directly, <hi>Lib. 1. de purgator. cap.</hi> 14.

                     </gap> And some of his Church affirms, That the Saints may be called, <hi>The Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others,</hi> though improperly.</q> But we are not concerned in these things, <hi>seeing</hi> (Now our <hi>Author</hi> appears upon the Stage again) from the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ; <q>it follows only, that those unto whom it is imputed, are <hi>Redeemed and Saved</hi> not at all; they are <hi>Redeemers and Saviours.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:205130:32"/> judgment is not reducible unto any of the grounds of the Imputation before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.

For he who is not perfectly Righteous, cannot be Righteous, in the sight of God, unto Justification.</q> (It's no wonder <hi>our Author</hi> let these Throat-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Arguments unobserved fly over his head.) 2. <q>It is not a <hi>naked Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> or Declaration of any one to be righteous, without a just and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent foundation for the Judgment of God declared therein. God declares no Man to be righteous, but he who is so; the whole Question being, How he comes so to be?</q> (Now, betwixt this of a Negative, and what the <hi>Dr</hi> declares as a Positive Imputation, does our <hi>Author</hi>'s Citation lie.) <q>Wherefore, 2.

Behold here a great Mystery! the Son of God, not only in our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Nature by Assumption, but in our Guilty Person by Imputation, stands before <hi>Pilate</hi> the Judge to be Sentenced by him. Why? What if Christ had been killed by any of the sundry Attempts of the Malicious Jews, made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Person; as by casting him head-long down the steep Rock, as once they made sure account of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 29. When they had him in the midst of them, yea and had laid hands on him, leading him to the brow of the Hill? No, it was not possible, in regard of the purpose of God's Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Justice, destinating his Son to such a Death as he must die, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26. That Christ could be so put to death by all the power and malice of Hell it self. For God's Wisdom so disposed, that the death of his Son should be such, as might be most effectual to satisfie and appease his Fathers Wrath, and give a Believer sure confidence in the day of Judgment, as <hi>S. John</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 28. Otherwise, if it had been so, that Christ had been kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in any such <hi>Tumultuous</hi> manner, or in <hi>Hugger-mugger,</hi> and not by a legal and judicial proceeding against him, How had his death secured us from the terror of God's Tribunal? Christ must die; but he must be first senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and judged to die by a lawful Judge: And such was <hi>Pilate;</hi> For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>Pilate</hi> was a Man, and so subject to be led away with Passion and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which, as a Bribe, doth blind the eyes even of the wise, and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ways of Judgment; yet a lawful Judge he was, deputed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that Province by <hi>Caesar;</hi> yea, by a greater than <hi>Caesar,</hi> even by God himself, who is the Judge of all the World. Therefore <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> in his Charge to the Judges, whom he sent, said, 2 <hi>Chron. 19. 6. Take heed what you do, for ye Judge not for Man; but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And such is the judgment and sentence, which proceedeth from the mouth of an earthly Judge, as that it is to be taken and received as the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sentence of God himself: As the <hi>Wise man</hi> speaks from the mouth of the Holy Ghost—<hi>Many seek the Ruler's favour; but every Man's judgment cometh from the Lord,</hi> Prov. 29. 26. Every Man's judgment? Yes, every Man's judgment; nay more, (which is also there implyed) Every judgment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be, whether true or false, right or wrong, it proceedeth (Shall I say from the Lord? Yes,) from the Lord. <hi>Every Man's Judgment cometh from the Lord.</hi> And yet many Men complain, that their cause is unjustly censur'd, and sentenc'd by the Judge: But God is just: And shall not he,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:205130:33"/> the Judge of all the World, do right? Doubtless he is most Just, and even that Judgment, which seemeth to us most unjust, coming from an earthly Judge; Yet the same Judgement coming from God is most Just. We will use no other instance, but that Judgment of <hi>Pilate,</hi> passed upon the Lord Jesus Christ the Innocent Lamb of God stands arraigned at the bar of <hi>Pilate's</hi> Jugdment seat: Many accusations are brought against him, but without any proof at all. And the Judge must go <hi>secundum allegata et probata,</hi> according to the allegations and proofs, or else, <hi>aequum licet statuerit, haud aequus fuit:</hi> Though he gives a Just sentence, yet himself is unjust. Well, the Jews with much vehement of mortal malice, accusing Christ before <hi>Pilate,</hi> but all without proof. <hi>Mat. 27. 18. v. 24. Pilate knowing that of envy the Jews had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him to be condemned,</hi> acquits Christ as an <hi>Iunocent person,</hi> and that solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before them all: But the Jews at length prevailing with their wicked im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, <hi>Pilate contra probata,</hi> passeth and pronounceth the sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon Christ, that he should dye, a most wicked and unjust sentence, if we consider the person of the Judge, <hi>Pilate,</hi> a man swayed by humane affections (and especially fear of men, the bane of many a good cause) who against his own conscience, pronounced Christ guilty and worthy of death, whom he knew to be no other, but a most innocent person. But now, take me this Judgment as proceeding from the tribunal of God, and we shall see it to be most Just: For in or with Pilate, God sits upon the tribunal to Judge his own son: But God and <hi>Pilate</hi> pass the same sentence with a most different res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon Christ. For Christ here sustains a two fold person; His own which only <hi>Pilate</hi> looked upon, not knowing any other; And so <hi>Pilates</hi> sentence of death was most unjust: But Christ bare another person upon him, to wit, our sinfull person; Which God looking upon, and finding now in our stead, a guilty person by the Imputation of our sins, being our <hi>Surety;</hi> He passeth the same sentence of death upon him, that <hi>Pilate</hi> did, and yet God's sentence is most Just. Yea but God the Judge must go also, <hi>secundum allegata et probata,</hi> according to due allegations and true proofs: Yea they were most false: True; But consider now as he stood in our person, so all the allegations and accusations brought against him were most true. <hi>Mat. 27. 13, 14. Mat.</hi> 15. 3 4, 5. In which respect Christ at the hearing of them was silent; As he that wanted his wedding garment, was speechless, because Christ knew that he stood there in our person; Against whom, what accusation of sin can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but may easily be proved? Christ was accused of two main impieties; Against God, and aginst the King and the people; As a perverter, and a traitour, <hi>Luk. 22. 70, 71. Ch. 23. 2. Jo.</hi> 19. 12. All this was true; For sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Person, standing as <hi>our Surety,</hi> and undertaking to discharge all our debts, what debt was so great, what sin so grievous, that he now stood not charged withall and was not culpable of? This made him to be <hi>numbred among Transgressors,</hi> not common offenders, but <hi>transgressors,</hi> among Criminals, yea Capital malefactors: And for this very reason even <hi>Barabbas</hi> a seditious murderer is preferred before him; if Christ had not thus stood in our stead, been Judged and condemned in our persons, he had never saved the theif up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:205130:34"/> the cross, and therefore as <hi>St. Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>nemo est, qui possit e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

In Psal. com.</hi> There is none that can be shut out, when the theif is let in; And standing in our stead, if he had not been formally and legally Judged, and so condemn'd, we should never have been able to have stood before God's Judgment seat. But now Christ being cast and condemn'd by a lawfull Judge, ordained and appointed of God; So that this Judgment was not man's Judgement, but God's: That gives a <hi>supersedeas,</hi> and a <hi>quietus est,</hi> to all true believers, and penitent sinners that they shall most assuredly stand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and righteous before God's Judgment seat, seeing their sins are already absolutely Judged and condemned; For as Christ was legally condemned in our person; So shall we be before God's tribunal acquitted and absolved, as Just and righteous in his person, <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. 33, 34 for, <hi>who shall now lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect; It is God that Justifyeth: Who shall condemn? It is Christ that dyed.</hi> Osingular unspeakable comfort to all true believers! The debt is discharged, and we are free; Christ is Judged, and we acquitted; He is condemned, and we are absolved; His chastisement is our peace; His stripes our healing; <hi>So that now being Justifyed by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. Now we may with comfort and confidence, Rom 5. 9. 1. Thess 1. 10. Wait for the Son of God from heaven, whom God raised from the dead, even Jesus, which hath delivered us from the wrath to come;</hi> As saith the Apostle; And all this, for that was Christ in his own person innocent, but in ours guilty, was Judged and condemned, even by God's own Judgment; Though by the mouth of a mortal man; Yea an unjust, though a lawful Judge. It is not therefore for nothing, that in our Creed we say, he suffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate:</hi> O happy suffering under <hi>Pontius Pilate!</hi> But why under <hi>Pontius Pilate!</hi> How comes <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> in our <hi>Christian Creed?</hi> Surely not for any honour due to his name, or to his person; But in memory of his office and calling, as he was a Judge, who passed sentence on the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ▪</hi> This very <hi>Article,</hi> where <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> is mentioned, is a strong Argument to persuade me, that those who compiled this <hi>Creed,</hi> called <hi>the Apostles Creed,</hi> did it by the special instinct of the <hi>holy Ghost;</hi> And in this very Article doth this <hi>Creed</hi> excel all other <hi>Creeds,</hi> sith it, of all the rest, expresseth the manner of Christ's condemnation, which being done by <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the Judge, is the very life and Soul of our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. I have dwelt the longer upon this point, as being a mystery of rare and singular use to the Church of God. I confess I have looked into sundry Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techists and Expositours upon the <hi>Creed,</hi> but I have not had the hap to meet with any to lead me thus to consider of this point of Christ's suffering under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> as a lawful Judge.

For this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those dayes, saith the Lord; I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a People.</hi> Vers. 12. <hi>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Which I take to be pretty well and full explained, Psal. 103. 3. Psal. 130. 3, 4. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; who healeth all thy diseases. If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared.</hi> But it seems <hi>our Author</hi> is otherwise minded, as we shall find: In that his Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the place, does necessarily infer a [<hi>wherefore</hi>] in stead of a [<hi>for</hi>] v. 12. Wherein his Grammar, as well as Logick, are gone a Wool-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together after his Divinity: for this he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 56, 57. I shall wholly Transcribe him, as to his matter, least he suggest that I wrong him—<q>1. Whom is this Covenant made with? It's with the House of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel;</hi> not the Men in present being, but Men to be hereafter. It's <hi>after those dayes I will make it;</hi> so that it was after the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Covenant was to expire, <hi>v.</hi> 32. And it could not be the only Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> for that had its <hi>being</hi> from the Fall, (or rather its discovery, for its being is from Eternity) and the sincere <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> did not lose the advantages of it by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Dispensation, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle argues, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 17. The point before us, is to know, who this <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> be. 1. If it terminate on the natural <hi>Jews,</hi> it's the strongest Text for the conversion of the People, and describes the extent of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to all; and the manner of it, <hi>viz.</hi> by an immediate influence for the most part; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving their iniquities, refers to their sin, in Crucifying Christ, for which that blindness came upon them, that is here removed: If you take it in this sense, yet here is a Law written in the heart, which includes faith, in order to God's being their God, and the remission of their sins.—2. If true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or they are inwardly <hi>Israelites</hi> are meant, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. Then 'tis plain that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:205130:36"/> there is faith in all such, who are parties, with whom God makes this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; They are the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. And no unbelievers are <hi>Israel.</hi> In this Notion: If you take it thus, the text imports, preseverance, great sanctification, and high improvements in holiness and knowledge, great near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to and amity with God, &amp;c. As the benefits secured and reserved for the new Testament-times, and all these to Multitudes—2. It cannot be inferred from this scheme of the New—Covenant, that (as <hi>the Dr.</hi> would have it) God doth not require any duty as the Condition of the benefits which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to give, For here's God's Law written in the heart before our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him as his people, or the pardon of sins; And <hi>though this text include the effects and materials of the Covenant, yet it doth not describe the whole form of the Covenant, for in other places God requires the new heart as a Condition of life. Ezek. 18. 31. Jer.</hi> 7. 28. One would think, that, that in the Hebrew, and whence it is quoted doth rather include the nature as well as form of the Covenant of grace, than the two forecited texts?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, whether <hi>the Dr.</hi> is more his Colleague in the office of an Interpreter, than in his testimony, wherein he would force him to witness for him against <hi>Dr. Crisp,</hi> what follows will discover.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This is the great fundamental promise and grace of the new Covenant, for though it be last expressed, yet in order of nature it precedeth<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr. Owen</hi> on the place.</note> the other mercies and priviledges mentioned, and is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Collation or Communication of them unto us. This is the Causal <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whereby the Apostle rendereth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Prophet, doth demonstrate. <hi>What I have spoken,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>shall be accomplished, for I will be merciful, &amp;c.</hi> Without which there could be no participation of the other things mentioned; Wherefore not only an addition of new grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is expressed in these words, but a reason also is rendred why or on what grounds he would bestow on them those other mercies. The house of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> with whom this covenant was made in the first place, and who are spoken of as representatives of all others who are taken into it, and who thereon become the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, were such as had broken and disanulled God's former Covenant by disobedience; <hi>Which my covenant they brake.</hi> Nor is there mention of any other qualification, whereby they should be prepared for or disposed unto an entrance into this new Covenant. Wherefore the first thing in order of nature, that is to be done unto this end; is the free pardon of sin: Without a supposition hereof, no other mercy can they be made partakers of. For whilst they continue under the guilt of sin, they are also under the curse; Wherefore a reason here is rendred, and that the only reason, why God will give unto them the other blessings mentioned, <hi>for I will be merciful, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Free and sovereign, undeserved grace, in the pardon of sin is the Original spring and foundation of all covenant mercies and blessings. Hereby and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alone is the glory of God and the safety of the Church provided for. And those who like not God's Govenant on these terms, as none by nature, will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally fall short of the grace of it. Hereby all glorying and all boasting in our selves is excluded, which was that which God aimed at in the contrivance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:205130:36"/> and establishment of this Covenant. <hi>Rom. 3. 27. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 29, 30, 31. For this could not be, if the fundamental grace of it did depend on any condition or quallification in our selves, if we let go the free pardon of sin, without respect unto any thing in those that receive it, we renounce the Gospel; Pardon of sin is not merited by antecedent dutyes, but is the strongest obligation unto future dutyes. He that will not receive pardon, unless he can one way or other deserve it, or make himself meet for it, or pretends to have received it, and finds not himself obliged unto universal obedience by it, neither is, nor shall be partaker of it?</q>

               <p>Now let <hi>the Reader</hi> Judge, and that as to two things, 1. Who speaks most the Language of <hi>Dr. Crisp</hi> as to the substance and matter thereof, <hi>Dr. O.</hi> Or our pretty pert <hi>Author?</hi> 2. Whether (as we hinted before) of thofe texts cited by <hi>our Author,</hi> that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. 12. Or these of <hi>Exek. 18. 31. And Jer</hi> 7. 23. Have more in them, as descriptive of the Covenant of grace, as to its form. <hi>Let him that runs</hi> read, though he assign it to the latter; And what that means we know full well enough. I would desire the Reader diligently to compare them.</p>
               <p>The other Text which <hi>our Author</hi> manages to make way for his corrupt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, of, <hi>Phil. 3. 8, 9 is, Isa. 64, 6. p.</hi> 172. 173. <q>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Doth not <hi>Israel.</hi> say, all our Righteousnesses are as filthy rags? Ans. But that is spoken of persons, and not of real holiness. It's the same, as <hi>Micha. 7. 4. The best of them▪ is a bryar.</hi> And <hi>Isa. 16. From the crown of the head to the sole of the foot we are putrifying sores.</hi> Corruption had invaded the very priests and the generality of the best profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, who seemed the most righteous. And that the sense of the place refers to persons, see the verse before. <hi>Thou meetest him that rejoyceth and worketh righteousness &amp;c. Behold thou art wrath, for we have sinned; q. d.</hi> Were we workers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, thou wouldest meet us, and we should rejoyce; But because we are not so, but have sinned, thou art wroth. See v. 7. <hi>There is none that calleth on thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold on thee, q. d.</hi> We are all remiss, the best of us are prayerless, see the 6th v. it self, <hi>we are all as unclean things; Our righteousness are as filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf. q. d.</hi> There's a general Apostacy and degeneracy among us. But allow that it were spoken of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness as a quality; Will it follow that because the dead shadow of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, in so backsliding and defiled a people, was rags, that therefore the lively actings, of grace, through the influence of the Spirit, must be menstrous cloaths or rags. <hi>Dr. Owen</hi> speaking on <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6.

               </p>
               <p>I shall add to this Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> upon <hi>Job, ch. 27. p.</hi> 324.—<q>As to the business of Justification, <hi>our righteousness is dross and dung, yea, all our Righteousnesses are as filthy rags,</hi> (Isa. 64. 6.) Not only are those righteous acts filthy which are done (as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did theirs) for self-ends, or in hypocrisie; but there is a filthiness (as they are done by us in those righteous acts which are done to a right end, or in sincerity; and therefore the most righteous Person must not <hi>hold</hi> his righteousness, he must <hi>let it go Though I were righteous,</hi> (saith <hi>Job, ch. 9. 15.) yet would I not answer</hi> (in a legal way, for Justification in my self;) <hi>but I would make supplication to my Judge;</hi> that is, I would humble my self, and beg his pardon. And again (v. 21.) <hi>Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my own Soul.</hi> But when it cometh to a case or controversie between him and his Friends, then he held fast his Righteousness, the Righteousness of his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Conversation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This leads us to a consideration of that Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. as managed by <hi>Antisozzo</hi> and <hi>our Author,</hi> distinctly; but I shall set down the former's own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary observations, as to the matter in hand, <hi>p</hi> 546.—<q>But now let the <hi>Reader</hi> take something warm next his heart, let him use his Phyal of Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for <hi>our Author</hi> is just now a coming to examine those Texts of Scripture, which are abused by these Men, to set up the Personal Righteousness of Christ, as the only <hi>formal</hi> cause of our Justification. And must not those Texts of Scripture be miserably abused indeed, that are prest in for such a Service? What is the Personal Righteousness the <hi>formal</hi> cause of our Justification? I have heard some say it was the Meritorious cause, some the Impulsive cause, others the Material cause, and some, that it is No cause: But, <hi>our Author</hi> is the first that ever I heard this expression from. There was once a good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Bishop (as Orthodoxy past in that Age) his Name <hi>Downham;</hi> he hath written many a long Page upon this Subject; and he acquaints us with the Sense of Protestants, <hi>Lib. 1. Cap. 3. Sect.</hi> 1. That the matter of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Christ's Righteousness, and the form is God's imputing it. And this may go with most of your Systematical Divines. But from hence I learn, it's the Mode nowa-dayes, for these Gentlemen to Confute (that is, to rail at) those long-winded <hi>Authors,</hi> they never had the Patience to Read, nor the Brains to understand; but, let this pass among <hi>our Author's</hi> Negligences, or Ignorances, till I understand better where to Marshal it. In the examining
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:205130:37"/> the Texts which they abuse, he will begin and end with, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9.</q> Not far unlike <hi>our Author,</hi> who begins with it in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and almost closes his <hi>Book</hi> with the same.</p>

                           <p>THe main Question here will be, What was that Righteousness which the Apostle renounces, from having any place in his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God? Upon this one hinge hangs all the Controversie betwixt our Author and his Antagonists. They say it was, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Inherent Righteousness he had attained, or could attain; whatever Obedience he had performed, or could perform to the Commands of Gods. Ay, (but sayes our Author) What Proof have they for this? He can learn none, but that they take it for granted, that my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness signifies inherent righteousness; And really they are to be pittyed if not pardoned, that by his own righteousness, understand his own righteousness; for if inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be not his own righteousness, it's plain he could have none at all; for an external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of actions to the Law alone, is not righteousness alone, but hy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> pocrisie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness. 1. That which he calls his own righteousness <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>; he tells you in the next words, is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>; that which is from Law, any Law indefinitely. Now a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is from a Law, is such a one as the Law urges, presses upon, and prescribes to the Conscience: But that, without question, is an internal conformity of Soul to the holiness of the Law: But the Apostle rejects it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he rejects internal and inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness. 2. The true notion of my righteousness
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:205130:38"/> is not to be fetcht from some sorry conjectures, from precarious Hypotheses, which Men (when they are in straights) invent, to avoid present ruine, but from the stable, fixed, constant use thereof in Scripture; but so is this Expression (<hi>my own Righteousness</hi>) and (my own, or your own works) used in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> for real sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cere conformity of heart and life to a Law. Therefore so ought we to take it here, till we see cogent reason to the contrary. That this is the fixed use of the expression in Scripture, we shall see, <hi>Gen. 30. 33. My righteousness shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for me in time to come.</hi> VVhich our Author would Paraphrase thus. <hi>My righteousness,</hi> that is, my Roguery. Job 27. 6. <hi>My righteousness I hold fast; my heart shall not reproach me, as long as I live. My righteousness,</hi> that is, (would he say,) my Hypocrisie. Mat. 5. 16. <hi>That Men may see your good works,</hi> that is, in the New Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, your Complement. Dan. 9. 18. <hi>We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not our supplications before thee for our righteous<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness, but for thy great mercies.</hi> The Prophet, in the Name of the Church, must be supposed here not to renounce real righteousness, but the Sceleton of Obedience. Now had the Apostle designed only to reject his own hypocrisie, he was not so barren in expressions, but he could have fitted it with a proper Name. 3. The Apostle expresly renounces both, whatever he had attained before or after his Conversion, v. 7. <hi>These things that were gain</hi> (whilst I was a Pharisee) <hi>those I accounted</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>) <hi>loss for Christ.</hi> But is that all? No. <hi>Yea doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>less</hi> (v. 8.) and I do (<hi>now</hi>) account (<gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>) <hi>all things but loss,</hi> when I was convinced: And I do now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things, even my own righteousness, loss and dung for Christ. And therefore it is to be noted, that the Apostle rises higher in his earnestness, v. 8 <hi>Yea doubtless,</hi> q. d. Did I say, that I once looked upon all as loss for Christ? I will speak a bolder word than that. <hi>I account all but loss, dung, filth, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having my own righteousness.</hi> And that he speaks of that esteem and value he had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:205130:38"/> of his present righteousness, is yet further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from this, that it was in reference to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture day, the day of Judgment, that he might be found in Christ in that day, not sticking to his own righteousness. Two things our Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor returns to this.</p>
                           <p>1. It's a sufficient answer to say, they need not signifie so. I confess, for want of a better, the Answer may pass. A bad shift is better than none; and half a Loaf is better than no bread; but if a Man had no better, it was the sorriest <hi>Answer</hi> in the VVorld. I see when Men are prest with express Scripture, and yet are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (cost what will) to adhere to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, it's advisable, to cast about, to turn their thoughts into all shapes imaginable, to hunt for the extreamest possibilities; if a word, a phrase, an expression is but capable of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense, let it be probable, or improbable, true, or false, agreeable to the scope of the place or alien, all is a case; something must be said, that they may not seem to say nothing: and if they can say, it's possible it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise (as who cannot) though they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themselves, they hug themselves for their ready wit, and applaud themselves for grave respondents. A little matter will blow away their dust: Let them shew where ever my righteousness is otherwise used, and then let them boast of a bare possibility.</p>
                           <p>2. My own righteousness (sayes he) can signifie no more than that wherein he placed his righteousness. I beg his pardon, it signifies more than that wherein he placed his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, whilst a Pharisee; and a great deal less than that, wherein he placed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness after Conversion, in order to Justification. But if the Apostle renounced whatever he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his righteousness in then, either he placed it in inherent righteousness, or not; if not then how dares our Author place his righteousness there, where the Apostle does not? If he did ever place his righteousness in it, then here he openly declares before the VVorld, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:205130:39"/> it. But (sayes our Author) VVhat necessity is there to understand this of inherent holiness? VVe have shew'd you the necessity before, and shall do hereafter. An external righteousness serves most Mens turns very well; not so well neither as he may imagine. And this is the righteousness, by which the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees (and amongst the rest St. <hi>Paul</hi> whilst he was a Pharisee) expected to be justified. But stay a while, 1. VVe have proved that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle not only renounced that righteousness whatever it was that he had, whilst a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see: But that which was his own at the time when he made that solemn renunciation of it; whatever he had attained, or might possibly attain, all went, that he might be found in Christ in the great day. 2. The Pharisees were generally bad enough in all conscience; and he need not make them worse. It's a sin, we say, to bely the Devil. It doth not appear, that the Pharisees exacted to be justified before God, by an external obedience only, without sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It was not their principle, though hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie (as to many individuals) might be their practice. The case is frequent before our eyes; a Drunkard, a Common-Swearer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will tell you they hope to be saved, though they are wicked; but none durst ever assume the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to expect Salvation because he was wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: No; he will repent when he can intend it, and trust to the general Grace of God, and some such reserves, which our Modern-Pulpit Drollery has furnisht him withal. 3. As to <hi>Paul,</hi> whilst he was a Pharisee (if we take his own word for it, when he was none,) he was no Hypocrite, he every where vindicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as to that; his persecuting was his great crime, in which he protests his sincerity. Act 26. 9. <hi>I verily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.

                           <p>Aye but (sayes our Author) what his righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness was he tells us, v. 6, 7. <hi>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, &amp;c.</hi> So that my own Righteousness which is of the Law is so far from Signifying an inherent Righteousness, a vital principle of holiness, that it only signifies an external Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which consisted in some external Rites, as Circumcifion, and seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or an external civility and blamelesness of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. This proceeds upon a double false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. 1. That the Apostle renounces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what he attained, whilst he was a Pharisee. 2. That whatsoever he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, v. 6, 7. did constitute his <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Righteousness: For 1. I must cut him off cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; That was no part of his own Righteousness. A priviledge it was; But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing performed by him▪ and therefore could not expect Justification by it; Unless our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will grant, that he had a spice of the doctrine of imputing the obedience of another to him for Justification. 2. For sacrifices the Apostle mentions them not, renounces them not, for he understood too well their use and proper end in the Jewish Church; That they were their visible Gospel, and did lead to Christ (whom now he owned) Though then he was ignorant of him. The conscientious and believing use of sacrifices might put in for a place in Justifying the sinners, with better right, than such obedience to the Moral Law, as a man was able in his present state to perform. 1. Consider them as meer acts of obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the thing done is not so considerable, as the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:205130:40"/> subjection of the conscience to the Authority of God the sovereign Law-giver: Which in this case is most signal, for here is only the will and pleasure of God for the reason of that Costly and operose service; Whereas moral duties are vouched for, by the suffrage of the light and reason of Nature. 2. Consider them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for their peculiar end, the leading and conducting of faith to Christ; And so they far exceed and out strip any thing, the moral Law (being become weak through the Flesh) could assist the sinner in; For so they are said, actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to procure pardon of sin, actually to make attonement and reconciliation, <hi>Lev 17. 11. I have given you it (the blood) upon the Altar to make an attonement for your souls; For it is the blood that maketh an attonement for the Soul. 2 Chro. 29 24. The Priests, killed them</hi> (the sacrifice) <hi>and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an attonenement for all Israel.</hi> Now let him shew me, wherever attonement, reconciliation, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>nnext to the actual performance of the Moral Law. It is true that the original design of the Moral Law was Justification, but not the Justification of a sinner; But man being now become such, the Law is utterly incapable of reaching it's primitive end. And it's as true also that sacrifices upon their own account could not supply that defect, but as directing the sinner to him who is the grand propitiation, and from whose death they received all their vertue and efficacy. 3. As to his being of the stock of <hi>Israel,</hi> and as the natural seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> should be Justified, cannot be proved. 4. For external ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and blamelessness of conversation, it would have gone a great way in our Authors account at any other time. p. 384. He asks the question with some heat and briskness: What? Live a blameless, innocent, honest, smooth life, and yet live in some sin or other? <hi>Paul</hi> would have past for a righteous person upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the ticket of a blameless conversation in that sect, though in this he is rated at for a hypocrite, and all that's naught. But whatever
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:205130:40"/>
                              <hi>Paul</hi> was or was not, whilst a Pharisee, it makes no great matter to the business in hand, seeing he has so freely and openly disowned, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was his own righteousness after conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the matter of Justification before God.</p>
                           <p>But to confirm all this (sayes our Author) we must observe a double Antithesis in the words. We must? What? Whether we can, or no? What, if there be but one single Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis? It's no matter; We must observe a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Antithesis, if we will perchase our peace and quiet. I promise you this Antithesis is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard word, <hi>graecum est, non potest intelligi;</hi> And I should as soon chuse to swallow <hi>Dr. Jacombs</hi> conjuction (at which our Author made such a sowr face in the begining of this section) as this crabbed Antithesis, much more then a double Antithesis. But what's this double Antithesis? Why (saies he) The righteousness of the Law is opposed to the righteousness which is by the faith of Christ: And my own righteousness opposed to the righteousness of God. There's your double Antithesis. Now (sayes he) the surest way to understand the meaning of this is to examine how these phrases are used in Scripture; But in my mind it will be surer, I am sure a more rational way, to examine first whether indeed there be such a double An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tithesis in the words as he pretends, or whether a single one will not content the Text: And the surest way to understand this, is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the words themselves. <hi>And be found in him, not having my own Righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness, which is of God by faith.</hi> Now if any one can find a double Antithesis, or in plain English a double opposition in these words, he must have eyes like a Cat, which some say, can see as well by night as by day, or however as well i th' dark as without light, <hi>not having my own righteousness which is of the Law.</hi>

                              </gap>. There's one member of the Antithesis, where the righteousness which is of the Law is a plain Exegesis (there's another hard word for you) of my own righteousness, and not any thing distinct from it, <hi>my own righteousness, which is of the Law;</hi> And then comes the other member of the Antithesis; <hi>But that which is through the faith of Jesus Christ, the righteousness, which is of God by faith.</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:205130:41"/> is as much as, <hi>videlicet? The righteousness by the faith of Christ,</hi> namely, or that is to say, <hi>the righteousness which is of God by faith.</hi> And thus <hi>Beza, non habens meam Justiciam</hi> (nempe) <hi>quae est ex lege: Sedeam quae est per fidem Christi,</hi> (id est) <hi>Justiciam</hi> (quae est) <hi>ex Deo per fidem</hi> Who for a smattering in that language will not envy our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor? So that nothing could by the wit or ignorance of man, have been more groundlesly, absurdly, and ridiculously invented, than this double Antithesis. And, 1. Let us observe how ill favouredly it was contrived. The text order is this. <hi>My own righteousness which is of the Law-That which is through the Faith of Christ, (even) the righteousness of God by Faith.</hi> Now if any man would needs have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Antithesis to do him some special service, it should have been laid between my own righteousness, and that which is by the faith of Christ; And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that of the Law, and the Righteousness of God by faith. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary our Author without any provocation, without any Umbrage of a pretence from the Text (like old <hi>Jacob</hi> crossing his hand) has laid them in a saltire; My own righteousness to the righteousness of God, and the righteousness of the Law to the righteousness by the faith of Christ. 2. Suposing all that he can desire, how do's this double Antithesis confirm that, which he contrived it to confirm, viz. That my own righteousness signified my external righteousness only. It has been an old saying, that one absurdity being granted, many more will easily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And yet so hard is this Gentleman put to it, that granting him a many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdityes, he cannot make one follow: But yet the Reader shall hear what he would observe out of this double Antithesis.</p>
                           <p>1. The righteousness of the Law (as you have already heard) is an external Righteousness, which consists in washings, purifications, sacrifices, or an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conformity to the Moral law; So we have heard indeed once and again affirmed, but never confirmed. The double Antithesis was brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it; And that must confirm the double Antithesis. I desire therefore once for all to hear, what the Righteousness of the Law, The Moral Law, is said to consist in externally. The righteousness of the Law is that Righteousness which the Law requireth. But the Law requires an internal conformity of heart to our outward actions, and of both to the Law of God: Therefore the righteousness of the Law consists also in an internal conformity—The Law condemns none that bring the righteousness of the Law; But the Law condemns those that bring only an external Conformity: Therefore external conformity is not the Righteousness of the Law. And from hence we may be abundantly satisfyed what was that Righteousness of his own, which the Apostle renounces. That which was his own Righteousness, that he renounces: But an internal inherent righteousness was his own righteousness: Therefore that he renounces. The Minor I prove. The righteousness of the Law, was his own righteousness; (<hi>not having my own Righteousness which is of the Law</hi>) But the Righteousness of the Law was an inherent internal Righteousness: Therefore his own righteousness was an inherent and internal righteousness. The minor I prove. That which the Law prescribes and Commands is the Righteousness; But, that which the Law prescribes and commands, is an internal inherent righteousness; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:205130:41"/> the righteousness of the Law is such a righteousness. That which God requires, his Law requires; But God requires truth in the inward parts, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther in Ceremonials, or Morals; Therefore the Law requires the same. And is it not now an unparrall'd piece of Nonsence, to call that the righteousnes<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> of the Law, which both the Law and the Author of it doth abhor? Externa<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Conformity alone is so far from being the righteousness of the Law, that it<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap> the unrighteousness of the Law. But hence the Reader will begin to get a glimmering into the true reason, that necessitated our Author to study his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a double Antithesis, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi>'s righteousness, which he renounceth might not seem to be the righteousness of the Law, which God required; tho<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> not in order to justification;) for if his own righteousness be the righteousness of the Law, and he so peremptorily renounces his own, then he renounces the righteousness of the Law also; and what that is, this one consideration is enough to convince us of; that the Law requires an absolute, perfect, entire conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole Man to it's demands and claims, without which no Man can expect to be justified by it. And seeing such is the case with poor impotent Man, that he cannot answer its demands and claims, he can never reasonably expect it should do him that service.</p>
                           <p>2. The righteousness by the Faith of Christ (sayes he) is an Internal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. Oh! but that should have been proved, soundly proved, not begg'd, or borrow'd, much less stolen, for it's the main thing in question. And of all things in the Syllogism, we should not stand to Courtesie for Conclusion. Why (sayes he) it's called being Born again, becoming New Creatures, Rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But still Proof! Proof is wanting; for we do think that those expressions do not denote that Righteousness, whereby we are constituted Just, in the sight of God; but Holiness and Sanctification of Nature, which the Gospel evidently distinguishes from that Righteousness, whereby we are Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But let him have Line enough.</p>
                           <p>3. His Second Antithesis is, between my own righteousness, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God; and he is considering with himself, in what sense they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. But there's no great difficulty in this (sayes he;) for the Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells us, that by his own righteousness he means the righteousness of the Law; and by the righteousness of God, the righteousness of Faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will give this a gentle wipe, and away. But now he has quite spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the humour of the double Antithesis; For if by his own righteousness, he means the righteousness of the Law; and by the righteousness of God, the righteousness of Faith, then there's but one single Antithesis. Between his own righteousness which is of the Law, (on the one part) and the righteousness by the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith (on the other part. But, at these rates, he might have given us a Treble, Quadruple, Sextuple Antithesis, and have rung as many changes, when his hand was once in, upon two Bells, as others can do upon six The Apostles words indeed were clear, very clear, till our Author found it necessary to obscure them, to deprave the Truth, and conciliate some small reverence to Error, to which two heads

<pb facs="tcp:205130:42"/> is the Moral Law, whose Righteousness <hi>Moses</hi> describes; Therefore it is the Moral Law, which the Apostle excludes from having any place in Justification.—The Major is evident from the connexion of the Apostle's words, v. 3.—<hi>They have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.</hi> Vers. 4, 5. <hi>For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that believeth. For Moses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth the righteousness, which is of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. The Minor I prove thus; That Law, which saith, <hi>He that doth these things, shall live in them,</hi> is that Law, whose <hi>righteousness Moses</hi> describeth. But it is the Moral Law which saith, <hi>He that doth these things shall live in them.</hi> Therefore it is the Moral Law▪ whose <hi>righteousness Moses</hi> describeth. The Major is the Apostle's own, <hi>v.</hi> 5. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor I prove from, Lev. 18. 5. <hi>You shall keep my statutes, and judgments, which if a Man do, he shall live in them.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to you.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>The nakedness of thy Father, or of thy Mother, thou shalt not uncover,</hi> &amp;c. From whence I argue thus; That Law which forbids incest, is the Moral Law; But that Law which saith, <hi>he that doth these things, shall live in them,</hi> is the Law which forbids incest; Therefore that Law that saith, <hi>he that doth these things shall live in them,</hi> is the Moral Law. Again, I argue thus, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11. That Law which hath the Curse annext to it, for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance in all things commanded therein, is the Law, which the Apostle excludes from having any place in the Justification of a sinner. But it is the Moral Law, which the Apostle excludes from having any place in the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a sinner.—The Major is evident from the place, v. 10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under a Curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> Ves. 11. <hi>But that no Man is Justified by the Law in the sight of God, is evident.</hi> The Minor I prove from <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. From whence the Apostle quotes—it. <hi>Cursed is he that continueth not in all the works of this Law, to do them.</hi>—That Law which forbids making Images, which forbids setting light by Father or Mother, which forbids removing Land-marks, which forbids causing the Blind to go out of the way, which forbids perverting of Judgment, Incest, Sodomy, is the Law which hath the Curse annext to it: But it is the Moral Law▪ which forbids all these things: Therefore it is the Moral Law▪ which hath this Curse annext to it. I cannot foresee what our Author will return to all this, but his old Tawdry Answer:—That indeed the Apostle does exclude the Moral Law; and therefore it must be highly impertinent to enquire what Deeds of the Law are excluded. But yet, for his further satisfaction, I shall bestow an Argument up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that also: Those acts of Obedience, to which the Promise of Life, in the Covenant of Works, originally was most directly made, are excluded from Justification. The Apostle has secured the Major, Rom. 10. 3 5, 6. <hi>They have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God. For Moses describeth the righteousness of the Law, that he that does these things shall live in them.</hi>
                              <pb n="80" facs="tcp:205130:43"/> The Minor is evident; For God never made a Promise of Life to external acts of obedience, without inward conformity of Soul to them, and of both to the Law of God. Again—Those Acts, the want whereof mainly exposes the sinner to the Curse, are excluded from Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; But the want of internal acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, mainly exposes the sinner to the curse; Therefore internal acts are excluded from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. And the true reason, why these inward acts are excluded from Justification, is not, because they are not well-pleasing to God▪ but because the case is thus with impotent fallen Man, that he cannot reach the <gap reason="foreign">

Here lyes his Jocking trade in Divinity, as▪</hi> pamper'd and plump'd up with a seeming Orthodoxy at first appearance, but by then he is sifted and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we shall find him foundring and Jading of all four.—And thus he deals with his Reader almost all along; Not far unlike that <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who failing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with his friend to stay with him, being a thick misty day did▪ under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of conducting him, so insensibly lead him about, that he fairly ended his Journey with the day, at the very place, from whence he first set out. Thus <hi>our Author.</hi> Now the Law, it is true, condemns every sin, and that even in believers themselves, yet not believers as to their persons: But to say, that those, who have performed Gospel-conditions, as <hi>our Author</hi> words it, which I suppose even in his own sense, is to be actually introduced into the covenant of grace, and thereby to participate of its priviledges, that they in their persons stand as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable by the Law, is a Gospel-de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying Assertion. And herein he constantly manifests either his craft or ignorance by not distinguishing between persons and natures. For take an instance hereof in the Apostle Paul himself, whom, though we find complaining of and crying out under the remainders of sin, as adhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto his nature, which doubtless the Law condemned, and also was a plague to his own gracious heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Yet that he was in his person condemnable by the Law, and that from the imperfections that attended him, even when most conversant about good, though arising from the indwelling remaines of his corrupt nature, is absolutely false. <hi>Rom. 8. 1. ch.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3, 4.—Now this promiscuous Medley or Hodge-podge Divinity that <hi>our Author</hi> ever and anon pesters our eyes and ears with, to me appears to arise from hence, and indeed what will be found as to that on which it is that the whole of the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy is mainly founded, Namely, That he and others of his complexion and kidney, look upon <hi>Adam</hi> in his publick capacity, no otherwise, than as a fountain or spring is Head unto the streams that issue from them, and that by an immissive, or infusive, and continued repletive communication. So on the other hand, of Christ, That the Meritorious cause and Material fulness of grace is in him, and that as the spring of our Justification; But that the substance and matter thereof is in us, by a Physical Infusion, <hi>i. e.</hi> That in Christ the <hi>price</hi> of our Justification does lye▪ but in us the matter or the robe it self of righteousness is wrought, by vertue and through the merits of the same rendred acceptable; Which he frequently expresses in these and the like words—<q>
                  <hi>That the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and merits of Christ are the only righteousness, for which we are Justrfyed?</hi>
               </q> Also, p. 17. Speaking of Gospel-preaching, That it, amongst other things, consists in,—<q>
                  <hi>A directing all to look to Christ for stren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th and acknowledging him as the only Mediator, and his obedience and sufferings, as the sole attonement for sin, and meriting cause of all blessings?</hi>
               </q> Therefore of course it follows, That the Justification of our persons depends not only firstly upon the renovation of our Nature, but that as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is carryed on, so it is that the former becomes more and more acquitted from the condemning sentence of the Law: And hence it is also, that our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Justification is not compleatly attained unto in this life, (though such as are truly regenerated he grants, because therein they have attained unto it in the reality of it's kind) as to it's full measure and degree, till it be consummated in the perfection thereof in glory. This will appear to be an Undeniable, full
<pb facs="tcp:205130:44"/> figure and scheme of <hi>our Author</hi>'s sentiment of Justification, I say still <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               </gap> matter of it: For the truth of which I refer the unbiassed Reader to an impart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Where though he tells us that he owns the imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ for Justification, yet, sayes he, <hi>to ground it on this place, would be a great damage to the truth.</hi> Therefore see his concessions as to this, where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly declares his Judgment herein, and that in seven particulars, p. 32. 33. Nay, observe him throughout the whole chapter, which is the 7th. Also, p. 86. 87, 91, 110, 111, 112, 115. The same being also included in several other parts of his <hi>Treatise.</hi> And herein I must confess, he has no less than the whole <hi>council of Trent</hi> of his Judgment. <hi>Prima genuinaque notio, &amp;c. The prime and proper notion of this word Justification, is an acquisition of righteousness; Namely of unjust to be made Just; As calefaction or breaking of cold to be made hot. That the second, or notion next to this, is, that it signifyeth an augmentation of righteousness. Soto de nat. &amp; grat. bib. 2. c. 6. Again,</hi>—<q>
                  <hi>That the first Justification is a certain supernatural change, whereby a man of unjust is made Just. The second thus, that it is a supernatural change, whereby a man of Just is made more Just. And that these are also either active or passive, active in regard of God, working this Justification first and second in us; And passive in regard of man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who is changed, from bad to good, and from good to better? Vega de descript. Justifi. L. 5. in c. 4. decr. et de Justifi. cap.</hi> 11.</q> It is therefore no wonder, that a special friend of <hi>our Author</hi>'s should at <hi>Pinners-hall</hi> so fiercely plead for <hi>faith, repentance, and sincerity,</hi> and that as <hi>the very matter of our righteousness, wherein we</hi> must <hi>stand,</hi> if ever we <hi>stand Justifyed before God,</hi> even <hi>at the day of Judgment;</hi> Though he might▪ as <hi>our Author,</hi> assign the <hi>meritorious canse</hi> thereof wholly unto <hi>Christ's obedience and sufferings▪</hi> Also, That, <hi>there is no difference between us and the Papists, but what lies in words.</hi> Neither indeed is there upon these suppositions any great cause of a maze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to what <hi>this his pupil</hi> insinuates, p. 47. That our <hi>faith and repentance have some room in heaven,</hi> even <hi>when</hi> we are in that state of perfection. For in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> he looks upon the <hi>Wedding garment</hi> to be barely <hi>an uniting faith,</hi> and not that which <hi>faith receives by union,</hi> unless it be by <hi>sanctification,</hi> which I take to be <hi>his Justifying Robe;</hi> And am apt to think he designs to reserve it, whereever he layes it up for the present, as much unworn and unsullied as possibly he can fill then, for ought of it that I can discern either in the spirit, matter or Method of this his <hi>treatise.</hi> Now should he be deprived of these, viz. <hi>Faith and repentance,</hi> though actually possessed of heaven. He might very well (according to his profound <hi>Dictatorship</hi>'s Judgment) fear a being packt thence, as not having his title thereunto at hand by him, by which one would think, he not only hopes to be preserved from becoming speechless, (which would be half the ruin of one that loves to hear himself talk) but in spight of fate to secure his standing.</p>

And alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it that even a pleading for that, which is really and indeed true in it self; yet if in order to a misapplication of the same, it is in plain terms, but a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth of God into a lie.
